**PHES Dictionary** is a small Quarto website that renders a terminology dictionary
directly from a CSV file.

- Use the **Dictionary** tab in the navbar, or click here:  
  **[Open the Dictionary â†’](dictionary_documentation.qmd)**

::: callout-tip
### How this site works
- The page `dictionary_documentation.qmd` reads your CSV and renders each record
  as a term with **ID, Label, See also, Definition, Description, Background, Synonyms**.
- By default we read from the path set in the YAML header of that page:
  `params: dict_path`.
:::

## Getting started
1. Put your real CSV in the repository at `data_raw/your_file.csv`.
2. Open `qmd/dictionary_documentation.qmd` and set:
   ```yaml
   params:
     dict_path: "../data_raw/your_file.csv"
