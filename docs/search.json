In our review, the concept was identified as early as 1988, to reflect “the willingness of individuals and organizations to participate in the surveillance system”.

They are shaped by system design (e.g., simplicity, timeliness), perceived value (e.g., importance, relevance, trust), and social context (e.g., cultural fit, stigma, privacy concerns). High levels of acceptability and engagement improve data quality, sustainability, and stakeholder collaboration but may be limited by political will, resource constraints, and communication barriers.\nBackground Acceptability as a surveillance system attribute has evolved since its initial conceptualization. The original CDC 1988 definition focused on willingness of individuals and organizations to participate in surveillance activities. The 2001 CDC guidelines maintained this core concept while expanding factors that influence acceptability. Calba et al. (2015) broadened the concept to include not just willingness but “the degree to which each of these users is involved in the surveillance.” Contemporary understanding has further expanded to encompass community engagment, participation, and trust—reflecting a shift from traditional, top-down surveillance approaches to more collaborative models. This evolution acknowledges that modern surveillance systems must be acceptable to a wider range of stakeholders beyond traditional public health departments, including affected communities, healthcare providers, private sector entities, and various levels of government. The concept now implicitly recognizes cultural appropriateness, and ethical considerations as components of acceptability.\nSynonyms\n\nExact: N/A\n\nBroad: participation"

Accessibility in public health surveillance refers to how readily and consistently surveillance outputs (such as alerts, reports, or predictive model results) and input data (such as raw surveillance data or supporting information) are available to end-users, decision-makers, and planners. This includes availability through standardized and sustainable protocols, user-friendly dissemination mechanisms, and manageable data formats. Accessible systems reduce technical, administrative, logistical, and practical barriers, enabling timely decision-making and effective public health responses.\nBackground FAIR data concepts, introduced by Yang et al. in 2022, have become increasingly prominent. Definitions of accessibility commonly include providing data “when and how users need them,” although these elements overlap with system availability and communication and dissemination. Accessibility involves both output accessibility (ease of disseminating surveillance results to users) and input accessibility (consistent availability and usability of source data).

However, this concept has been defined inconsistently across the literature, with terminology varying by discipline - often referred to as validity, accuracy, or data correctness. The definition of accuracy that we have adopted aligns with the DQO and ISO/IEC 25012 definition. The definition aligns with established international standards, including ISO 8000-2:2020, which defines accuracy as the correctness of data relative to real-world conditions.

This attribute covers both technical standards (data formats, interoperability frameworks) and operational standards (case definitions, reporting procedures). Standards use is closely related to compliance, but differs in focus. While standards use focuses on internal consistency in following best practices and operational protocols, compliance is centred around relevant legislation, regulations and policies, including ethics and security. Beyond compliance, standards use is also tied to other data quality attributes/terms, and is positively correlated with consistency ans technical competence and training.\nBackground The concept of adherence was identified six times in our scoping review. However, the overarching concept referred to here was only identified by Yang et al., (2022), with elements of this definition being referenced multiple times throughout the literature (e.g., standards use, transparency). High adherence is essential for the consistent functioning of the system, as it reduces errors, ensures uniformity, and facilitates the accurate tracking of health-related events or environmental changes. A system with high adherence is more likely to produce accurate and high-quality data, as following established protocols reduces errors and inconsistencies.
