They are shaped by system design (e.g., simplicity, timeliness), perceived value (e.g., importance, relevance, trust), and social context (e.g., cultural fit, stigma, privacy concerns). High levels of acceptability and engagement improve data quality, sustainability, and stakeholder collaboration but may be limited by political will, resource constraints, and communication barriers.\nBackground Acceptability as a surveillance system attribute has evolved since its initial conceptualization. The original CDC 1988 definition focused on willingness of individuals and organizations to participate in surveillance activities. The 2001 CDC guidelines maintained this core concept while expanding factors that influence acceptability. Calba et al. (2015) broadened the concept to include not just willingness but \"the degree to which each of these users is involved in the surveillance.\" Contemporary understanding has further expanded to encompass community engagment, participation, and trust—reflecting a shift from traditional, top-down surveillance approaches to more collaborative models. This evolution acknowledges that modern surveillance systems must be acceptable to a wider range of stakeholders beyond traditional public health departments, including affected communities, healthcare providers, private sector entities, and various levels of government. The concept now implicitly recognizes cultural appropriateness, and ethical considerations as components of acceptability.\nSynonyms\n\nExact: N/A\nBroad: participation"

Accessibility in public health surveillance refers to how readily and consistently surveillance outputs (such as alerts, reports, or predictive model results) and input data (such as raw surveillance data or supporting information) are available to end-users, decision-makers, and planners. This includes availability through standardized and sustainable protocols, user-friendly dissemination mechanisms, and manageable data formats. Accessible systems reduce technical, administrative, logistical, and practical barriers, enabling timely decision-making and effective public health responses.\nBackground FAIR data concepts, introduced by Yang et al. in 2022, have become increasingly prominent. Definitions of accessibility commonly include providing data “when and how users need them,” although these elements overlap with system availability and communication and dissemination. Accessibility involves both output accessibility (ease of disseminating surveillance results to users) and input accessibility (consistent availability and usability of source data). Effective accessibility also requires sufficient human and technological resources, clear authorization balancing openness with privacy and security, and robust infrastructure for reliable data flow.\nSynonyms\n\nExact: N/A\nBroad: N/A"

Accuracy is influenced by several factors, including the sensitivity and specificity of case definitions, the clairty of surveillance forms (whether hardcopy or electronic), the technical competence and training of staff, and the care exercised in data management. It is positively correlated with several other data quality attributes/terms, including representativeness, precision, completeness, and consistency, and is negatively correlated with bias. System acceptability can influence how accurately data are captured and recorded.\nBackground\n\nAccuracy was identified as an independent concept on eight occassions, distinct from the definitions of \"data quality\" or \"data completeness and correctness\". However, this concept has been defined inconsistently across the literature, with terminology varying by discipline - often referred to as validity, accuracy, or data correctness. The definition of accuracy that we have adopted aligns with the DQO and ISO/IEC 25012 definition.\n\n\nThe definition aligns with established international standards, including ISO 8000-2:2020, which defines accuracy as the correctness of data relative to real-world conditions.

This attribute covers both technical standards (data formats, interoperability frameworks) and operational standards (case definitions, reporting procedures). Standards use is closely related to compliance, but differs in focus. While standards use focuses on internal consistency in following best practices and operational protocols, compliance is centred around relevant legislation, regulations and policies, including ethics and security. Beyond compliance, standards use is also tied to other data quality attributes/terms, and is positively correlated with consistency ans technical competence and training.\nBackground\n\nThe concept of adherence was identified six times in our scoping review. However, the overarching concept referred to here was only identified by Yang et al., (2022), with elements of this definition being referenced multiple times throughout the literature (e.g., standards use, transparency).\n\n\nHigh adherence is essential for the consistent functioning of the system, as it reduces errors, ensures uniformity, and facilitates the accurate tracking of health-related events or environmental changes. A system with high adherence is more likely to produce accurate and high-quality data, as following established protocols reduces errors and inconsistencies. It also enhances consistency by ensuring uniform application of procedures across time and by different personnel.

Bias can arise from multiple sources including diagnostic test characteristics, reporting practices, population coverage, sampling methods, case definitions, and temporal factors. The magnitude and impact of bias depends on surveillance objectives. For general population surveillance, bias can distort prevalence estimates and trend analysis, leading to incorrect public health conclusions.\nBackground\n\nBias was identified as a reported concept six times in our scoping review. The concept was first introduced by Hoinville et al., in 2013 and was consistently included in animal health surveillance system evaluation frameworks thereafter.

For environmental surveillance systems, this requires data that can be spatially or demographically linked to affected communities, stratified by indicators of vulnerability such as socioeconomic status, age distribution, or geographic marginalization. For human health surveillance, this extends to demographic attributes (race/ethnicity, gender, age), and in specialized frameworks, may include measures of structural determinants such as racism or stigma. For animal health surveillance, relevant factors include producer characteristics, economic constraints, and cultural factors (e.g., livestock’s role in local economies) that influence disease reporting and system participation. The attribute assesses whether the system’s data infrastructure enables identification of which populations are disproportionately affected and supports development of targeted, equitable interventions. This directly influences representativeness (ensuring no groups are systematically excluded) and acceptability (ensuring culturally appropriate engagement).\nBackground The concept of equity-relevant data in surveillance evaluation has three distinct but converging lineages. Traditional Public Health Surveillance (1990s-2000s): Foundational CDC guidelines from the 1990s required surveillance evaluation to consider disparities or inequities and assess data distribution by population demographics (race, ethnicity, age, socioeconomic status). This was traditionally addressed within the attribute of representativeness, which required collecting demographic characteristics and identifying systematically excluded population subgroups. One Health and Animal Health Frameworks (2013-present): Animal health and One Health evaluation frameworks identified that traditional approaches, focused on technical attributes like sensitivity, failed to capture the social and economic aspects influencing system performance. These frameworks required characterizing socioeconomic context, including local value systems, cultural importance of livestock, and economic constraints—factors that fundamentally shape surveillance effectiveness through their influence on acceptability and data quality. Health Equity and Anti-Racism Frameworks (2021-present): Public Health Critical Race Praxis (PHCRP) evaluation frameworks identified a critical gap: even systems collecting race/ethnicity data often fail to capture structural drivers of health inequities. PHCRP explicitly requires assessing whether systems capture measures of racism (such as residential segregation or discriminatory policies) and validated stigma indicators, moving beyond demographic categories to measure mechanisms producing inequitable outcomes. Convergence: These lineages converge in recognizing that adequate evaluation requires assessing whether systems collect data sufficient to identify who is disproportionately affected (demographics), why disparities exist (structural and contextual factors), and whether the system engages populations equitably (cultural appropriateness). Specific data elements vary by surveillance type, but the principle is consistent: equity-relevant data collection addresses not only demographic completeness but also the social, economic, and structural determinants shaping health outcomes and surveillance performance. This concept intersects with multiple traditional evaluation attributes including representativeness, acceptability, data quality, and usefulness.\nSynonyms\n\nExact: equity-relevant data, health equity data, disparities data\nBroad: social determinants data, demographic data, stratification variables, population characteristic data, vulnerability indicators"

High transparency builds trust, supports data interpretation, and facilitates informed decision-making. Challenges include inconsistent or delayed data sharing, which can reduce stakeholder confidence and limit timely responses. Transparency is linked to terms like acceptability and usefulness, as clear communication of methods and constraints helps users understand system strengths and weaknesses.\nBackground TBD\nSynonyms\n\nExact: N/A\nBroad: N/A"

High usability involves clear documentation (data dictionaries, manuals), minimal training requirements, and system workflows that align with user practices. It also considers how well data interpretations (e.g., statistics) are communicated, including accessibility features like language, cultural relevance, and format. The ability to stratify data by relevant factors (age, sex, geography) enhances usefulness. Regular user feedback guides system improvements.

The extent to which the system has benefited the end-users and led to specific public health actions, either in the form of assessments or measures. [OR] A public health surveillance system is useful if it contributes to the prevention and control of adverse health-related events, including an improved understanding of the public health implications of such events .\nDescription Usefulness reflects the system’s impact on preventing or controlling adverse health events and informing public health action. It is demonstrated through real-world outcomes, such as policy changes, early outbreak detection, or targeted interventions. Usefulness depends on how well outputs meet stakeholder needs and influence decision-making. Retrospective analysis and stakeholder input help assess alignment with health priorities. This attribute is closely tied to sensitivity, timeliness, and data completeness, which together enhance the system’s value in guiding effective, evidence-based responses.\nBackground TBD\nSynonyms\n\nExact: impact\nBroad: N/A"

The output may be qualitative or quantitative and may include probabilities, forecasts, digests, counts, warnings, or lists of outlying observations. The content attribute also spans the quantity and class of data produced by the event-based biosurveillance.
