# How to Update the Website

This guide is for team members who want to update the PHES EF website without using the command line or installing software.

## üìä Step 1: Update the Data (Excel file)

1. Open the Excel file in SharePoint/Teams:
   ```
   Wastewater Group - Evaluation > 5 - Scoping Reviews > PRQ1 - Current Evaluation Practices
   ```

2. Make your changes to the data

3. **Save the file** - OneDrive will sync automatically

That's it! The data is updated. Now you can publish the website when ready.

## üë• For Technical Users (Local Development)

### Initial Setup (One-time)

1. **Install Prerequisites:**
   - R (version 4.2.0 or higher)
   - Quarto CLI: https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/
   - Git

2. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Big-Life-Lab/phes-ef-scope-private.git
   cd phes-ef-scope-private
   ```

3. **Set up R environment (using renv - recommended):**
   ```bash
   # Restore all packages from renv.lock
   R -e "renv::restore()"
   ```

   This installs all required packages with correct versions.

   **Alternative - Direct install (if not using renv):**
   ```bash
   Rscript -e "install.packages(c('tidyverse', 'ggplot2', 'cowplot', 'here', 'fs', 'janitor', 'gt', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown', 'commonmark', 'readxl'))"
   ```
   If using direct install, you must disable renv when rendering (see commands below).

4. **Verify Quarto installation:**
   ```bash
   quarto check
   ```

### Daily Workflow

```bash
# 1. Pull latest changes
git pull

# 2. (If Excel file synced via OneDrive) Extract CSVs
Rscript R/extract_excel_to_csv.R

# 3. Validate data
Rscript R/validate_csv_data.R

# 4. Render website locally
quarto render

# 5. Preview website (optional)
quarto preview

# 6. Commit and push
git add docs/ data_raw/*.csv
git commit -m "Update website data"
git push
```

### Quick Commands

**Just render (no data changes):**
```bash
quarto render
```

**Render and preview:**
```bash
quarto preview
```

**If NOT using renv (using global packages):**
```bash
RENV_CONFIG_AUTOLOADER_ENABLED=FALSE quarto render
```

**Check for errors without rendering:**
```bash
Rscript R/validate_csv_data.R
```

### Troubleshooting Local Build

**R package errors:**
```bash
# Restore renv packages
R -e "renv::restore()"

# Or install missing package
R -e "install.packages('packagename')"
```

**Quarto errors:**
```bash
# Check Quarto installation
quarto check

# Update Quarto
# Download latest from https://quarto.org
```

**Path issues (Windows):**
Use Git Bash or set up WSL for better compatibility with Unix-style paths.
