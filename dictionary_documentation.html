<p><strong>Synonyms:</strong> <strong>Exact:</strong> N/A • <strong>Broad:</strong> participation</p>
<hr class="header-separator">
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The willingness of persons and organizations to participate in the surveillance system.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Acceptability reflects stakeholders’ perceptions and attitudes toward the surveillance system, including their willingness to participate. It encompasses recognition of the system’s importance, satisfaction with processes, trust in data management, perceived reporting burden, and alignment with ethical and cultural expectations. High acceptability is supported by clear communication, demonstrated value, privacy protections, and responsiveness to user needs.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Acceptability was identified as a foundational concept in the evaluation of public health surveillance, being identified on 34 occassions. In our review, the concept was identified as early as 1988, to reflect "the willingness of individuals and organizations to participate in the surveillance system". Overall, definitions have remained largely congruent with the one introduced in 1988. However, the concept has evolved through the incorporation of new elements such as trust and engagement.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement:</strong> TBD</p>

<p><strong>Synonyms:</strong> <strong>Exact:</strong> N/A • <strong>Broad:</strong> participation</p>
<hr class="header-separator">
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> N/A</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Acceptability and engagement reflect the willingness to participate in and the degree of involvement with a surveillance system. They are shaped by system design (e.g., simplicity, timeliness), perceived value (e.g., importance, relevance, trust), and social context (e.g., cultural fit, stigma, privacy concerns). High levels of acceptability and engagement improve data quality, sustainability, and stakeholder collaboration but may be limited by political will, resource constraints, and communication barriers.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Acceptability as a surveillance system attribute has evolved since its initial conceptualization. The original CDC 1988 definition focused on willingness of individuals and organizations to participate in surveillance activities. The 2001 CDC guidelines maintained this core concept while expanding factors that influence acceptability. Calba et al.&nbsp;(2015) broadened the concept to include not just willingness but "the degree to which each of these users is involved in the surveillance." Contemporary understanding has further expanded to encompass community engagment, participation, and trust—reflecting a shift from traditional, top-down surveillance approaches to more collaborative models. This evolution acknowledges that modern surveillance systems must be acceptable to a wider range of stakeholders beyond traditional public health departments, including affected communities, healthcare providers, private sector entities, and various levels of government. The concept now implicitly recognizes cultural appropriateness, and ethical considerations as components of acceptability.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement:</strong> Measuring acceptability often requires qualitative methods to capture user perspectives and motivations.</p>

<p><strong>ID:</strong> accessibilityData</p>
<p><strong>See also:</strong> data management and storage; <a href="#interoperability">interoperability</a></p>
<p><strong>Synonyms:</strong> <strong>Exact:</strong> N/A • <strong>Broad:</strong> N/A</p>
<hr class="header-separator">
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The ease with which authorized users can retrieve surveillance data and metadata using standardized protocols.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> [To incoporate FAIR in description]. Accessibility in public health surveillance refers to how readily and consistently surveillance outputs (such as alerts, reports, or predictive model results) and input data (such as raw surveillance data or supporting information) are available to end-users, decision-makers, and planners. This includes availability through standardized and sustainable protocols, user-friendly dissemination mechanisms, and manageable data formats. Accessible systems reduce technical, administrative, logistical, and practical barriers, enabling timely decision-making and effective public health responses.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> FAIR data concepts, introduced by Yang et al.&nbsp;in 2022, have become increasingly prominent. Definitions of accessibility commonly include providing data “when and how users need them,” although these elements overlap with system availability and communication and dissemination. Accessibility involves both output accessibility (ease of disseminating surveillance results to users) and input accessibility (consistent availability and usability of source data). Effective accessibility also requires sufficient human and technological resources, clear authorization balancing openness with privacy and security, and robust infrastructure for reliable data flow.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="accuracy">Accuracy</h2>
<p><strong>ID:</strong> accuracy</p>
<p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href="#precision">precision</a>; bias</p>
<p><strong>Synonyms:</strong> <strong>Exact:</strong> validity, data correctness, bias (Peyre 2019, 2022), comparability • <strong>Broad:</strong> data quality?</p>
<hr class="header-separator">
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The proportion of data entries that correctly reflect the true value of the data collected.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> [Comparison to the reference standard, ISO,varying definitions]. Accuracy is influenced by several factors, including the sensitivity and specificity of case definitions, the clairty of surveillance forms (whether hardcopy or electronic), the technical competence and training of staff, and the care exercised in data management. It is positively correlated with several other data quality attributes/terms, including representativeness, precision, completeness, and consistency, and is negatively correlated with bias. System acceptability can influence how accurately data are captured and recorded.</p>
<strong>Background:</strong>
<p>
Accuracy was identified as an independent concept on eight occassions, distinct from the definitions of "data quality" or "data completeness and correctness". However, this concept has been defined inconsistently across the literature, with terminology varying by discipline - often referred to as validity, accuracy, or data correctness. The definition of accuracy that we have adopted aligns with the DQO and ISO/IEC 25012 definition.
</p>
<p>
The definition aligns with established international standards, including ISO 8000-2:2020, which defines accuracy as the correctness of data relative to real-world conditions. It also corresponds to definitions in the Data Quality Ontology (DQO), which emphasizes accuracy as the correctness and precision with which data represent reality. Accuracy assessment often involves validation procedures, comparisons against reference standards, or independent verification processes.
</p>
<p><strong>Measurement:</strong> The accuracy of a surveillance system can be accessed using historical data or simulations. To assess its effectiveness in detecting outbreaks, key metrcis should include the number of outbreaks detected, false alarms, and outbreaks missed or detected late. These assessments should be integrated into the system’s routine workflow and have the ability to be conducted with minimal effort or complexity. Routine reporting should be automated where possible. Essential data include: the number of statistical aberrations detected at a set threshold in a defined period of time (e.g., frequency per month at a given p-value); actions taken in response to signals (e.g., review for data errors, in-depth follow-up analysis of the specific conditions within the syndrome category, manual epidemiologic analysis to characterize a signal, examining data from other systems, and increasing the frequency of reporting from affected sites); resources allocated for follow-upt; public health response (e.g., an alert to clinicians, timely dissemination of information to other health entities, a vaccination campaign, or no further response); documentation of how every recognized outbreak was detected; an assessment of the value of the follow-up effort (e.g., the effort was an appropriate application of public health resources); a detailed description of the agent, host, and environmental conditions of the outbreak; and the number of outbreaks detected only late in their course or in retrospect.</p>

<p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href="#compliance">compliance</a></p>
<p><strong>Synonyms:</strong> <strong>Exact:</strong> N/A • <strong>Broad:</strong> standards use</p>
<hr class="header-separator">
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The degree to which a surveillance system follows and implements established guidelines, protocols, classification systems, and data exchange standards in its core and supporting functions.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Standardization encompasses adherence to recognized guidelines across multiple dimensions of surveillance systems, including methodological protocols, data structures, classification systems, and exchange formats. This attribute covers both technical standards (data formats, interoperability frameworks) and operational standards (case definitions, reporting procedures). Standards use is closely related to compliance, but differs in focus. While standards use focuses on internal consistency in following best practices and operational protocols, compliance is centred around relevant legislation, regulations and policies, including ethics and security. Beyond compliance, standards use is also tied to other data quality attributes/terms, and is positively correlated with consistency ans technical competence and training.</p>
<strong>Background:</strong>
<p>
The concept of adherence was identified six times in our scoping review. However, the overarching concept referred to here was only identified by Yang et al., (2022), with elements of this definition being referenced multiple times throughout the literature (e.g., standards use, transparency).
</p>
<p>
High adherence is essential for the consistent functioning of the system, as it reduces errors, ensures uniformity, and facilitates the accurate tracking of health-related events or environmental changes. A system with high adherence is more likely to produce accurate and high-quality data, as following established protocols reduces errors and inconsistencies. It also enhances consistency by ensuring uniform application of procedures across time and by different personnel. Furthermore, training and supervision play a critical role in maintaining adherence, as they ensure that individuals are well-equipped to follow protocols correctly and consistently.
</p>
<p><strong>Measurement:</strong> Evaluating adherence involves assessing key factors such as the presence of an auditing process to ensure protocols are consistently followed, and whether data collection methods are standardized to maintain high-quality data. It also requires examining the use of harmonized indicators and metrics across sectors to ensure consistent data interpretation. Additionally, adherence can be evaluated by reviewing the use of standardized data elements (e.g., LOINC for lab tests) and electronic data interchange protocols (e.g., Health Level 7). Regular documentation of system protocols, including surveillance strategies and methodologies, is important. Additionally, verifying the enforcement of mandatory requirements for system implementation and data reporting is critical for ensureing full adherence</p>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The direct and indirect advantages produced by the surveillance system.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> [Carol’s + time horizon component]. The benefit term is influenced by several factors, including the scope of surveillance objectives, the effectiveness of data use in decision-making, and the capacity for early detection and response. It encompasses direct and indirect outcomes such as cost savings, improved public and animal health, enhanced trade, and prevention of losses in productivity, morbidity, and mortality. Benefits are positively correlated with terms such as timeliness, usefulness, and stability, and are shaped by stakeholder engagement and collaboration. The distribution of benefits across sectors also informs the overall value of the surveillance system.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Benefit was identified as an independent concept nine times in our scoping review, distinct from related concepts such as costs, impact, and efficiency. The concept was first introduced by Hoinville et al., in 2013 and was consistently included in animal health surveillance system evaluation frameworks thereafter. The definition has remained largely unchanged with the execption of Calba et al., 2015 introducing the idea of assessing whether users are satisfied that their requirements have been met in their definition. Their paper also focused solely on non-monetary benefits. However, despite the alignment of this definition across animal health surveillance evaluation frameworks, benefit was not identified as a standalone concept in the context of public health surveillance.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement:</strong> The evaluation methods for the benefits of surveillance activities involve identifying and quantifying both direct and indirect benefits. One approach includes contingent valuation methods (CVM) like proportional piling, where stakeholders are asked what they would be willing to pay for improvements such as sanitary information. The evaluation process should list all potential benefits, categorize them, and quantify market benefits where possible. Non-monetary benefits, such as improved public health or consumer confidence, should also be considered using alternative methods like quality-adjusted life years (QALY). Additionally, the distribution of benefits across various stakeholders, such as producers, consumers, and the livestock industry, should be assessed. The relationship between surveillance, intervention, and the mitigation of losses should be explored, as many benefits arise from integrated disease control. Finally, the evaluation should capture indirect benefits like enhanced trade opportunities and the improved capacity to respond to future threats or outbreaks.</p>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The extent to which a prevalence estimate produced by the surveillance system deviates from the true prevalence value.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Case detection bias occurs when systematic measurement errors cause surveillance data to systematically differ from the true occurrence of the health event in the target population. Bias can arise from multiple sources including diagnostic test characteristics, reporting practices, population coverage, sampling methods, case definitions, and temporal factors. The magnitude and impact of bias depends on surveillance objectives. For general population surveillance, bias can distort prevalence estimates and trend analysis, leading to incorrect public health conclusions.</p>
<strong>Background:</strong>
<p>
Bias was identified as a reported concept six times in our scoping review. The concept was first introduced by Hoinville et al., in 2013 and was consistently included in animal health surveillance system evaluation frameworks thereafter. The definition has remained largely unchanged with the execption of Peyre 2019 &amp; 2022 incorporating the idea of "bias=accuracy" in their definition. Despite its frequent application in evaluating animal health surveillance systems, the term "bias" was not identified in the context of public health surveillance.
</p>
<p>
Evaluating bias in surveillance systems is essential for accurately monitoring endemic diseases.
</p>
<p><strong>Measurement:</strong> Evaluating case detection bias (also called ascertainment bias) involves assessing systematic errors that affect a surveillance system’s ability to accurately identify and classify cases or events. This includes selection bias (when certain cases or populations are systematically over- or under-represented) and information bias (when data collection methods systematically affect measurement accuracy). Bias represents the consequence of measurement errors that can be characterized through surveillance performance measures such as sensitivity, specificity, and representativeness. Evaluating bias involves assessing potential sources, such as diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, underreporting in passive surveillance, and how the sample population is chosen (e.g., animals from abattoirs might not represent the overall population). Additionally, geographic, demographic, or ecological factors can contribute to bias. To quantify and correct for bias, methods like comparison across multiple data sources, simulation models, statistical methods, or capture-recapture analyses can be used. Assessment of bias (systematic error) should address the following: * Selection bias: systematic differences between sample and target populations * Performance bias: systematic differences between groups in care provided or in exposure to factors other than the interventions of interest * Detection bias: systematic differences in how the outcome is determined (eg, death scene investigation protocols) * Attrition bias: systematic loss to follow up * Reporting bias: systematic differences in how people report symptoms or ideation * Other: biases related to a particular data source</p>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong> All expenses associated with the surveillance system, including direct costs (e.g., equipment, personnel) and indirect costs (e.g., training, data management infrastructure).</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Cost is a key consideration in evaluating surveillance systems, reflecting their value and efficiency. Costs are both direct (e.g., personnel, data collection, laboratory services, infrastructure) and indirect (e.g., follow-up efforts for false alarms, impact on agency credibility). New or improved systems incur start-up (e.g., software, equipment) and ongoing operational costs (e.g., staff, maintenance). Economic analyses should balance these costs with the public health benefits, such as early outbreak detection and disease prevention, to assess overall value. Direct and indirect costs are usually collected and reported separately.</p>

<p><strong>Measurement:</strong> To evaluate costs, all elements of the surveillance system must be considered, including planning, sample collection, analysis, reporting, and dissemination. It’s important to distinguish between fixed costs (e.g., permanent staff salaries) and variable costs (e.g., sample collection or reagents).

<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Proportion of the population of interest (target population) or proportion of areas of interest (e.g.&nbsp;specific habitats or high- risk sites) that is included in the surveillance activity.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Coverage indicates the extent to which the target population or geographic areas are included in surveillance. High coverage enhances representativeness, sensitivity, and early detection—especially for emerging threats. It is related to sampling strategy, reporting completeness, and access to high-risk populations. Mathematically, coverage is the proportion the same represents divided by the total target population size.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Coverage was identified as a reported concept six times in our scoping review. The concept was first introduced by Hoinville et al., in 2013 and has since been consistently included in animal health surveillance system evaluation frameworks. The definition has remained highly consistent within animal health surveillance, aligning with the concept of "population coverage" in public health surveillance.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement:</strong> Coverage can be assessed by the proportion of respondents (survey-based) or cases (hospital- or facility-based) included in the surveillance system. Key measurements include population undercoverage, which occurs when parts of the target population are missed, and population overcoverage, where elements outside the target population are included. A demographic analysis can provide benchmarks for assessing completeness of coverage in the existing surveillance data and document changes in coverage from previous periods. Additionally, systems like farmer-based clinical surveillance, syndromic surveillance, or periodic sampling surveys benefit from regular evaluations to identify gaps or misrepresentation in coverage. By reviewing the geographic coverage and the number of areas of interest, it is easier to determine if the surveillance system adequately represents the target population. Furthermore, temporal coverage can be assess by determining the conditional probability that any given unit in the population will be examined or tested within the specified time frame. For example, if the target time frame is 7 days, but testing occurs every 4 weeks, the temporal coverage would be 25%. An assessment of coverage could include: * Characterisation and qualitative comparison of the sampled and target populations. Alternatively, comparison of sampled areas or habitats versus areas or habitats of interest. * Where sufficient data on the target population/areas or habitats of interest exists, simple calculations of the proportional coverage can be made (e.g.&nbsp;75% of the national herd and 45% of cattle holdings are sampled annually or 30% of the marine ports). * Where sufficient information on the background population, or high-risk areas or habitats respectively, is lacking, more sophisticated sampling designs might be employed (e.g.&nbsp;capture-recapture analysis or drop camera surveillance). * Considering whether the target population, or area of interest, has been adequately defined (i.e.&nbsp;whether the exclusion of certain animals or holdings or sites is merited). * The unit of interest - the level at which coverage is measured - is often the unit of interest of surveillance (e.g.&nbsp;animal, holding, high-risk site or specific marine habitat). If insufficient data exist, alternative perspectives might be desired. Coverage might then be assessed at other aggregate levels (e.g.&nbsp;geographical areas) or relevant intermediate steps in the surveillance pathway (e.g.&nbsp;the proportion of veterinary practices submitting diagnostic samples). * In certain contexts it may be worth establishing a timeframe of reference (e.g.&nbsp;annual coverage). The choice of timeframe should reflect the epidemiology of the disease or life history of a risk organism.</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong> Data analysis was cited as a concept in surveillance system evaluation nine times in the literature, spanning public health, animal health, and One Health surveillance system evaluation frameworks. The definition remains largely consistent, <em>&lt;+ relfecting uniformity across disciplines, with refinment over time, to emphasize the use of contextual information (e.g., prior likelihood of disease) in risk-based analysis and the need for analysis/interpretation to be performed timely to support decision-making and action. +&gt;</em></p>
<p><strong>Measurement:</strong> The evaluation of the data analysis attribute/term focuses on assessing the methods used to analyze surveillance data. It includes identifying the techniques applied, such as basic statistics, trend analysis, or more advanced methods like time series and spatial analyses. The evaluation checks if the limitations of the data have been properly considered and addressed in the analysis. Additionally, it evaluates whether the data is being fully utilized or if there are opportunities for further analysis. Reviewing past user needs and whether the analysis methods have met these demands is also important to ensure the analysis is delivering valuable, actionable insights. An evaluation of data analysis should include: The identification of the analysis methods applied to surveillance data: * No analysis * Basic descriptive statistics * Examination of trends * More sophisticated statistical approaches (e.g.&nbsp;time series analyses, spatial analyses); An assessment of whether the limitations of data have been understood and accounted for in statistical analyses?; An indication as to whether the body of data available is being fully exploited or could further use of data be made? It may help to review requirements for information made by users of the surveillance data in the past, to determine whether their needs were met by the methods applied.</p>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The use of appropriate data sources and collection methods, including a clear a case definition and a data collection protocol.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Effective data collection relies on clearly defined and complete case definitions or risk organism descriptions, including case signalment, clinical and pathological signs, and epidemiological information, and, where relevant, laboratory or taxonomic identification. Diagnostic methods must align with the case definition and be assessed for sensitivity and specificity. A written protocol should guide data and sample collection, with mechanisms to ensure adherence. Data collection methods should be clearly documented, and collection methods should minimize redundancy, address data gaps, and employ appropriate sampling strategies (e.g., risk-based or pooled).</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Data collection is a fundamental surveillance activity consistently recognized in evaluation frameworks across public, animal, and One Health systems (five instances within the literature review). Data collection was explicitly mentioned as a concept in the evaluation of surveillance systems in five instances within the literature, including a clear definition and integration into the animal health surveillance field. It is commonly cited as the most costly and difficult component of a surveillance system to implement (Chaudron, 2010; Peyre et al.&nbsp;2022).</p>
<p><strong>Measurement:</strong> Questions to consider when assessing data and information collection include: * Is there (if applicable) a written case definition/organism description for this surveillance system that is clearly defined and complete, with specified inclusion and exclusion criteria? If so Does the case definition/organism description include relevant details of the case signalment, clinical and pathological signs and epidemiological information as appropriate? Does the case definition include laboratory diagnosis? Alternatively does the organism description include taxonomic ID? Are the chosen diagnostic/taxonomic methods appropriate to the case definition/organism description, including in terms of samples being collected? Are syndromes used and - if yes - defined in an appropriate way? In those sectors where symptomatic surveillance is * Is there (if applicable) a written case definition/organism description for this surveillance system that is clearly defined and complete, with specified inclusion and exclusion criteria? If so undertaken, are symptoms clearly defined for when samples need to be taken? * Is there a written sample and/or data collection protocol and are there appropriate assurance mechanisms to ensure the protocols are followed? * Have the sensitivity and specificity of the tests used been assessed (where relevant)? * Are there data collected that are not used in analysis, interpretation or surveillance management (redundancy)? * Are there information needs for which data are not currently collected and feasibly could be? * Are appropriate sampling strategies used, including the use of risk-based approaches and pooled sampling? This could include risk-based requirement calculations or risk- based sampling. The basis of the risks used in the design of the risk-based sampling strategy should be reviewed. Data collection methods should be clearly documented. It may help to review demands for information made by users of the surveillance data in the past, to determine whether their needs were met by the data available.</p>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The proportion of data that were intended to be collected that actually was collected.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Completeness refers to the extent to which all required data are captured, reported, and available for analysis. A system with high completeness allows for more reliable decision-making and enhances the system’s usefulness. Incomplete data may result from issues with data collection, management, or communication, undermining the system’s effectiveness. Regular submission from all contributors and strong data management practices help improve completeness. Ensuring completeness strengthens data quality.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Completeness was identified as an independent concept on 12 occassions, distinct from the definitions of "data quality" or "data completeness and correctness". The concept was first introduced by Thacker et al., in 1988 (A method for evaluating systems of epidemiological surveillance), however it was not indentified as an evaluation concept until 1993 by Cutts et al.&nbsp;The definition of completeness has remained largely unchanged over the years, maintaining consistency across disciplines. It is primarily regarded as a key aspect of data quality and continues to be one of the most frequently used concepts for evaluating surveillance systems.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement:</strong> An evaluation of completeness should involve assessing the proportion of cases that were identified and subsequently reported to the system, which can be done through register/database reviews. Additionally, examining the percentage of “unknown” or “blank” responses to items on surveillance forms offers a straightforward and effective measure. The evaluation should also address challenges faced in both manual and automated data management. This includes identifying issues such as coding errors or data loss in manual systems, and programming errors or inappropriate data filtering in automated systems. These evaluations help identify gaps in data reporting and ensure that the surveillance system captures all relevant cases accurately.</p>

Assessing this attribute will require an intimate understanding of the data systems employed by the surveillance activity.
</p>
<p>
Data management and storage involve the systematic handling, processing, and safeguarding of data throughout its lifecycle. This includes ensuring data quality, accessibility, and security. Effective data management requires robust protocols for processing, verification, storage, and backup, as well as measures to control access and maintain confidentiality where necessary. An essential consideration is the appointment of a dedicated custodian responsible for overseeing these activities.
</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> TBD</p>
<p><strong>Measurement:</strong> Evaluating data management and storage involves reviewing the database structure to verify that data fields are well-defined, consistent, and correctly normalized, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval. Evaluators should check that primary keys uniquely identify records and that validation constraints and cross-consistency checks are in place to prevent invalid data input. The documentation supporting the database, such as data dictionaries and entity relationship diagrams, should be reviewed to confirm that it facilitates clear interpretation and understanding of the data. Additionally, the evaluation should assess the existence and sufficiency of data management protocols, including data quality standards (e.g., ISO9000, Good Clinical Practice). This involves reviewing records management policies, retention protocols, and periodic quality control checks. Data security and access control protocols must also be evaluated, ensuring only authorized personnel can access sensitive data.Furthermore, back-up and storage procedures should be tested to confirm data is securely stored and can be recovered if needed. Interviews with data custodians or managers may provide insights into the system’s functionality and reliability. Overall, the evaluation will require a comprehensive review of the system’s design, documentation, and operational practices to ensure proper data handling and storage. An assessment of this attribute should include: 1.Consideration of whether the database structure has been correctly designed: <em>Has each field of data been tightly defined to ensure correctness, conciseness and consistency across records? </em>Have primary keys, uniquely identifying each record, been assigned? <em>Has the database been normalised, to ensure data is stored in the most parsimonious, transparent and useable way? </em>Have validation constraints, preventing the input of invalid data, and internal cross-consistency checks been applied? <em>Is the data stored in a way that allows the required interrogation and analysis?; 2.Consideration of whether documentation of the data is sufficient to facilitate interpretation and understanding of the data: </em>Is there a document providing a summary overview of the data and collection methods and explaining any idiosyncrasies relevant to the analysis and interpretation of the data? <em>Is there a data dictionary that clearly defines each field? </em>Is there an entity relationship diagram that explains how the data relate?; 3.Consideration of whether there are adequate and documented protocols for managing data quality and security: <em>Is the data management system covered by a data quality standard (e.g.&nbsp;ISO9000, Good Clinical Practice or Good Laboratory Practice)? </em> Are periodic data quality control checks implemented? <em>Are records management issues clearly defined, including policy on the retention of data? </em> Are data back-up and storage protocols in place?</p>

Electronic systems can enhance data quality by improving accuracy, timeliness, and accessibility. Data quality is linked to terms such as timeliness, acceptability, representativeness, and usefulness, and directly affects the reliability and usability of system outputs for decision-making and public health response.</p>
<strong>Background:</strong>
<p>
Data quality has historically been defined by the core attributes of completeness and validity. It is routinely recognized as essential across public health, animal health, and emerging One Health surveillance frameworks. In the context of animal health, the term "data completeness and correctness" is used as an exact synonym for data quality.
</p>
<p>
In more recent years, data quality includes the concept of fit-for-purpose, with sufficeint quality to meet the need of the data’s intended purpose. As surveillance systems evolve, particularly through the use of informatics and electronic systems, data quality is enhanced and expanded. Electronic systems can improve data quality by facilitating accuracy, timeliness, accessibility, and reducing the potential for manual entry errors. As data systems evolve, data quality has been enhanced and expanded with the use of robust data management systems and automated data flow processes. The concept is highly interrelated with other performance metrics; for instance, poor quality data reduces system acceptability and representativeness.
</p>
<p><strong>Measurement:</strong> Can be measured as the proportion of data intended to be collected that was actually collected (completeness) and the proportion of data entries that correctly reflect the true value of the data collected (validity/accuracy). Includes proportion of unknown, invalid, and missing values for reported data elements. Validity may be estimated by the proportion of errors in surveillance system data compared to analogous data from one of the system’s data sources. Measures for determining data quality include percentages of "unknown," invalid, and missing responses to items on data collection forms. In addition, data quality can be measured by applying edits for consistency in the data. However, a full assessment may require a special study. The acceptability and representativeness of a public health surveillance system are related to data quality. With data of high quality, the system can be accepted by those who participate in it. In addition, the system can accurately represent the health-related event under surveillance. Paper-based systems, such as the E-Book registry, are more prone to human error, and can result in illegible, missing, and incomplete entries. An electronic system could increase data quality. Moreover, conversion to an electronic system would improve the timeliness, accessibility, and usability of captured data, as well as allow greater flexibility in responding to health events in a community. Many data-quality definitions depend on other system performance attributes (eg, timeliness, usefulness, acceptability) (21). Because of reliance on multiple data sources, data quality must be assessed in different ways. For surveillance relying on surveys, concepts of reliability, validity, and comparison with alternative data sources are important. For example, considerations of possible data-quality concerns arise with use of mortality data, particularly underreporting of suicide. It should be assessed using measures of completeness, consistency, and comparison with alternative sources to ensure reliability across diverse data types and collection methods.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> Flexibility is the system’s ability to adapt to new information needs, emerging threats, or changing resources with minimal disruption. This may involve modifying data sources, case definitions, or reporting mechanisms. Standardized formats and modular designs support flexibility. It is closely related to sustainability, resilience, and system responsiveness.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> The concept of flexibility was identified 39 times in our scoping review. The concept was first introduced by Thacker et al., 1988 (A method for evaluating systems of epidemiological surveillance) and has since been consistently included for the evaluation of public health, animal health, and One Health surveillance systems. The definition has remained highly consistent within these fields, although occasionally being refered to as "adaptabilit"y or "adaptability to changes".</p>
<p><strong>Measurement:</strong> Flexibility is probably best evaluated retrospectively by observing how a system has responded to a new demand. Unless efforts have been made to adapt the public health surveillance system to another disease (or other health-related event), a revised case definition, additional data sources, new information technology, or changes in funding, assessing the flexibility of that system might be difficult. In the absence of practical experience, the design and workings of a system can be examined. Simpler systems might be more flexible (i.e., fewer components will need to be modified when adapting the system for a change in information needs or operating conditions).</p>

The evaluation should assess the extent to which the system’s objectives have been achieved, providing a clear understanding of its impact on public health and disease management. Retrospective assessments and stakeholder feedback help evaluate whether the system’s outputs have guided effective actions. Regular review of system performance and stakeholder input helps ensure continued relevance and effectiveness in addressing public health threats. Retrospective assessment through stakeholder input helps capture real-world benefits, such as improved disease detection, control, or prioritization.</p>

<hr class="header-separator">
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The ability of a surveillance system to capture information on several hazards; measure of how generic the system is.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Multiple utility describes a surveillance system’s capacity to collect information on several hazards, reflecting how generic and adaptable it is. Systems with high multiple utility can support various surveillance objectives, improving cost-effectiveness and overall value. This term is positively linked to acceptability, sustainability, flexibility, and cos. Both realised and potential multiple utility should be assessed to identify opportunities for improvement. Systems with broad, representative designs generally offer greater multiple utility than those narrowly focused on specific risks.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> TBD</p>
<p><strong>Measurement:</strong> An assessment of multiple utility should consider: - What additional information is or could be gathered during sample collection (eg on animal health or husbandry and demographics)? - What other types of samples are or could be collected at the time of sampling? - What other diseases are or could be tested for with the samples collected? - How long are samples stored following testing and could they be used for other purposes (including other research purposes)? For a surveillance system to offer value to other diseases or information needs, the objectives and processes of the system should be aligned to other systems. So it may be expected that more simple systems are likely to have more potential for multiple utility. For example, a simple random survey of holdings, repeated annually and with good coverage and representativeness could be useful for various diseases; whereas a risk-based design aimed at a specific threat may be of limited value for other diseases with differing epidemiology.</p>

<hr class="header-separator">
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The proportion of reported cases that actually have the health-related event under surveillance.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Positive Predictive Value (PPV) is the proportion of cases identified by a surveillance system that are true cases. A high PPV indicates fewer false positives, which helps minimize unnecessary investigtations and conserves resources. PPV is influenced by the specificity and sensitivity of case definitions, as well as the prevalence of the condition in the population. As sensitivity and PPV approach 100%, a system is more likely to be representative of the population with the event under surveillance. However, as sensitivity increases, PPV may decrease; therefore, a balance should be maintained between prioritizing early detection and accuracy. PPV may also influenced by data quality, communication, and reporting practices.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> TBD</p>
<p><strong>Measurement:</strong> To assess PVP, external data sources, such as medical records, health claims, or registries, are often used as benchmarks to verify the true cases identified by the surveillance system. The assessment of sensitivity and of PVP provide different perspectives regarding how well the system is operating. Depending on the objectives of the public health surveillance system, assessing PVP whenever sensitivity has been assessed might be necessary (47-50,53 ). In this report, PVP is represented by A/(A+B) (Table 3). Evaluating Positive Predictive Value (PVP) involves assessing the accuracy of case detection and outbreak identification based on reported data. This can be done on two levels: individual case detection and epidemic detection. For case detection, the PVP is determined by confirming reported cases through investigation and comparing the number of true cases to the total number of reported cases. This requires keeping records of all interventions triggered by the surveillance system, such as the number of case investigations conducted and the proportion of cases confirmed. For epidemic detection, the PVP is assessed by evaluating the proportion of detected outbreaks that are true epidemics. This can involve reviewing personnel activity reports, travel records, and telephone logbooks to determine if resources are being misdirected due to false-positive case reports. Additionally, external data sources, such as medical records or registries, may be used to validate reported cases and improve the accuracy of PVP calculations. To obtain a comprehensive understanding, it may be necessary to assess PVP for different data sources, system data fields, and specific health-related events. Regular analysis of these factors ensures that the system effectively uses resources and minimizes the impact of false-positive results.</p>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The time between any two steps in the surveillance process.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Timeliness refers to the speed at which data are collected, reported, analyzed, and used to guide public health action. The required level of timeliness depends on the health event—rapid reporting is critical for acute, highly transmissible diseases, while less urgent conditions may allow for slower reporting. Timeliness is influenced by surveillance system design, resource availability, and event complexity. Delays in lab results or data flow can hinder timely response, especially in resource-limited settings. It must be balanced with accuracy and completeness and aligned with surveillance goals such as outbreak detection, trend monitoring, or long-term planning.</p>

<hr class="header-separator">
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The extent to which information can be and is shared across member agencies.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Transparency refers to how openly the surveillance system shares information about its data collection methods, analysis processes, and limitations with stakeholders and end-users. High transparency builds trust, supports data interpretation, and facilitates informed decision-making. Challenges include inconsistent or delayed data sharing, which can reduce stakeholder confidence and limit timely responses. Transparency is linked to terms like acceptability and usefulness, as clear communication of methods and constraints helps users understand system strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> TBD</p>
<p><strong>Measurement:</strong> Measurement may involve assessing frequency, clarity, and accessibility of data reports and documentation.</p>

<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Data and products produced by the surveillance system should be tailored to meet the needs of intended users.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Usability assesses whether surveillance data and products are tailored to meet the needs of intended users. High usability involves clear documentation (data dictionaries, manuals), minimal training requirements, and system workflows that align with user practices. It also considers how well data interpretations (e.g., statistics) are communicated, including accessibility features like language, cultural relevance, and format. The ability to stratify data by relevant factors (age, sex, geography) enhances usefulness. Regular user feedback guides system improvements. Usability links closely with acceptability and usefulness, influencing how effectively data informs public health actions.</p>

<hr class="header-separator">
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> [Wasn’t sure how much we would want to frame this definition around public health]. The extent to which the system has benefited the end-users and led to specific public health actions, either in the form of assessments or measures. [OR] A public health surveillance system is useful if it contributes to the prevention and control of adverse health-related events, including an improved understanding of the public health implications of such events .</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Usefulness reflects the system’s impact on preventing or controlling adverse health events and informing public health action. It is demonstrated through real-world outcomes, such as policy changes, early outbreak detection, or targeted interventions. Usefulness depends on how well outputs meet stakeholder needs and influence decision-making. Retrospective analysis and stakeholder input help assess alignment with health priorities. This attribute is closely tied to sensitivity, timeliness, and data completeness, which together enhance the system’s value in guiding effective, evidence-based responses.</p>
