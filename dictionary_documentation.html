<p><strong>Definition</strong> The ability of the surveillance system to continue tracking an event throughout the event life cycle.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> An event-based biosurveillance may be quite successful in detecting or forecasting an outbreak of disease, but it may lose its sensitivity as the event progresses (e.g., due to a high background level of indicators following a media announcement).</p>

<p><strong>ID:</strong> – <strong>Label:</strong> Acceptability <strong>See also:</strong> <a href="#engagement">engagement</a>; <a href="#collaboration">collaboration</a></p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong> The willingness of persons and organizations to participate in the surveillance system.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> Acceptability reflects stakeholders’ perceptions and attitudes toward the surveillance system, including their willingness to participate. It encompasses recognition of the system’s importance, satisfaction with processes, trust in data management, perceived reporting burden, and alignment with ethical and cultural expectations. High acceptability is supported by clear communication, demonstrated value, privacy protections, and responsiveness to user needs.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong> Acceptability was identified as a foundational concept in the evaluation of public health surveillance, being identified on 34 occassions. In our review, the concept was identified as early as 1988, to reflect "the willingness of individuals and organizations to participate in the surveillance system". Overall, definitions have remained largely congruent with the one introduced in 1988. However, the concept has evolved through the incorporation of new elements such as trust and engagement.</p>

<p><strong>ID:</strong> – <strong>Label:</strong> Acceptability and engagement <strong>See also:</strong> <a href="#acceptability">acceptability</a>; <a href="#engagement">engagement</a>; <a href="#collaboration">collaboration</a></p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong> N/A</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> Acceptability and engagement reflect the willingness to participate in and the degree of involvement with a surveillance system. They are shaped by system design (e.g., simplicity, timeliness), perceived value (e.g., importance, relevance, trust), and social context (e.g., cultural fit, stigma, privacy concerns). High levels of acceptability and engagement improve data quality, sustainability, and stakeholder collaboration but may be limited by political will, resource constraints, and communication barriers.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong> Acceptability as a surveillance system attribute has evolved since its initial conceptualization. The original CDC 1988 definition focused on willingness of individuals and organizations to participate in surveillance activities. The 2001 CDC guidelines maintained this core concept while expanding factors that influence acceptability. Calba et al.&nbsp;(2015) broadened the concept to include not just willingness but "the degree to which each of these users is involved in the surveillance." Contemporary understanding has further expanded to encompass community engagment, participation, and trust—reflecting a shift from traditional, top-down surveillance approaches to more collaborative models. This evolution acknowledges that modern surveillance systems must be acceptable to a wider range of stakeholders beyond traditional public health departments, including affected communities, healthcare providers, private sector entities, and various levels of government. The concept now implicitly recognizes cultural appropriateness, and ethical considerations as components of acceptability.</p>

<section id="accessibilitydata" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="accessibilitydata">accessibilityData</h2>
<p><strong>ID:</strong> – <strong>Label:</strong> Accessibility (data) <strong>See also:</strong> data management and storage; <a href="#interoperability">interoperability</a></p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong> The ease with which authorized users can retrieve surveillance data and metadata using standardized protocols.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> [To incoporate FAIR in description]. Accessibility in public health surveillance refers to how readily and consistently surveillance outputs (such as alerts, reports, or predictive model results) and input data (such as raw surveillance data or supporting information) are available to end-users, decision-makers, and planners. This includes availability through standardized and sustainable protocols, user-friendly dissemination mechanisms, and manageable data formats. Accessible systems reduce technical, administrative, logistical, and practical barriers, enabling timely decision-making and effective public health responses.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong> FAIR data concepts, introduced by Yang et al.&nbsp;in 2022, have become increasingly prominent. Definitions of accessibility commonly include providing data “when and how users need them,” although these elements overlap with system availability and communication and dissemination. Accessibility involves both output accessibility (ease of disseminating surveillance results to users) and input accessibility (consistent availability and usability of source data). Effective accessibility also requires sufficient human and technological resources, clear authorization balancing openness with privacy and security, and robust infrastructure for reliable data flow.</p>

<section id="accuracy" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="accuracy">accuracy</h2>
<p><strong>ID:</strong> – <strong>Label:</strong> Accuracy <strong>See also:</strong> <a href="#precision">precision</a>; bias</p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong> The proportion of data entries that correctly reflect the true value of the data collected.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> [Comparison to the reference standard, ISO,varying definitions]. Accuracy is influenced by several factors, including the sensitivity and specificity of case definitions, the clairty of surveillance forms (whether hardcopy or electronic), the technical competence and training of staff, and the care exercised in data management. It is positively correlated with several other data quality attributes/terms, including representativeness, precision, completeness, and consistency, and is negatively correlated with bias. System acceptability can influence how accurately data are captured and recorded.</p>
<strong>Background</strong>
<p>
Accuracy was identified as an independent concept on eight occassions, distinct from the definitions of "data quality" or "data completeness and correctness". However, this concept has been defined inconsistently across the literature, with terminology varying by discipline - often referred to as validity, accuracy, or data correctness. The definition of accuracy that we have adopted aligns with the DQO and ISO/IEC 25012 definition.
</p>
<p>
The definition aligns with established international standards, including ISO 8000-2:2020, which defines accuracy as the correctness of data relative to real-world conditions. It also corresponds to definitions in the Data Quality Ontology (DQO), which emphasizes accuracy as the correctness and precision with which data represent reality. Accuracy assessment often involves validation procedures, comparisons against reference standards, or independent verification processes.

<p><strong>ID:</strong> – <strong>Label:</strong> Adherence — suggest change to “Standards use” or “Standards adherence” <strong>See also:</strong> <a href="#compliance">compliance</a></p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong> The degree to which a surveillance system follows and implements established guidelines, protocols, classification systems, and data exchange standards in its core and supporting functions.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> Standardization encompasses adherence to recognized guidelines across multiple dimensions of surveillance systems, including methodological protocols, data structures, classification systems, and exchange formats. This attribute covers both technical standards (data formats, interoperability frameworks) and operational standards (case definitions, reporting procedures). Standards use is closely related to compliance, but differs in focus. While standards use focuses on internal consistency in following best practices and operational protocols, compliance is centred around relevant legislation, regulations and policies, including ethics and security. Beyond compliance, standards use is also tied to other data quality attributes/terms, and is positively correlated with consistency ans technical competence and training.</p>
<strong>Background</strong>
<p>
The concept of adherence was identified six times in our scoping review. However, the overarching concept referred to here was only identified by Yang et al., (2022), with elements of this definition being referenced multiple times throughout the literature (e.g., standards use, transparency).
</p>
<p>
High adherence is essential for the consistent functioning of the system, as it reduces errors, ensures uniformity, and facilitates the accurate tracking of health-related events or environmental changes. A system with high adherence is more likely to produce accurate and high-quality data, as following established protocols reduces errors and inconsistencies. It also enhances consistency by ensuring uniform application of procedures across time and by different personnel. Furthermore, training and supervision play a critical role in maintaining adherence, as they ensure that individuals are well-equipped to follow protocols correctly and consistently.

<p><strong>Definition</strong> The direct and indirect advantages produced by the surveillance system.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> [Carol’s + time horizon component]. The benefit term is influenced by several factors, including the scope of surveillance objectives, the effectiveness of data use in decision-making, and the capacity for early detection and response. It encompasses direct and indirect outcomes such as cost savings, improved public and animal health, enhanced trade, and prevention of losses in productivity, morbidity, and mortality. Benefits are positively correlated with terms such as timeliness, usefulness, and stability, and are shaped by stakeholder engagement and collaboration. The distribution of benefits across sectors also informs the overall value of the surveillance system.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong> Benefit was identified as an independent concept nine times in our scoping review, distinct from related concepts such as costs, impact, and efficiency. The concept was first introduced by Hoinville et al., in 2013 and was consistently included in animal health surveillance system evaluation frameworks thereafter. The definition has remained largely unchanged with the execption of Calba et al., 2015 introducing the idea of assessing whether users are satisfied that their requirements have been met in their definition. Their paper also focused solely on non-monetary benefits.

<p><strong>Definition</strong> The extent to which a prevalence estimate produced by the surveillance system deviates from the true prevalence value.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> Case detection bias occurs when systematic measurement errors cause surveillance data to systematically differ from the true occurrence of the health event in the target population. Bias can arise from multiple sources including diagnostic test characteristics, reporting practices, population coverage, sampling methods, case definitions, and temporal factors. The magnitude and impact of bias depends on surveillance objectives. For general population surveillance, bias can distort prevalence estimates and trend analysis, leading to incorrect public health conclusions.</p>
<strong>Background</strong>
<p>
Bias was identified as a reported concept six times in our scoping review. The concept was first introduced by Hoinville et al., in 2013 and was consistently included in animal health surveillance system evaluation frameworks thereafter. The definition has remained largely unchanged with the execption of Peyre 2019 &amp; 2022 incorporating the idea of "bias=accuracy" in their definition. Despite its frequent application in evaluating animal health surveillance systems, the term "bias" was not identified in the context of public health surveillance.

<p><strong>Definition</strong> Relationship between the expected outcomes and the costs of surveillance to achieve these outcomes. Surveillance system costs include direct costs (personnel and material resources), indirect costs (resulting from preparedness and response to surveillance findings), and prevention benefits or costs from a societal perspective (e.g., effects of the information generated on decision making and population health). Refers to the relative expenditures (costs) and outcomes (effects) of different surveillance strategies, determining whether the improved health outcomes or surveillance capabilities justify the associated costs to help inform efficient resource allocation decisions (kirsh 2008 adpated for surveillance).</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> The costs of obtaining surveillance information needs to be balanced against the benefits derived. Assessment of surveillance resources typically focuses on direct costs. Because of the complexity of surveillance and response processes, it is usually difficult to define indirect costs. For some infectious disease surveillance systems, investigators have modeled the expected future costs of strategies for continued vaccination, surveillance, and other public health activities. Efforts to improve sensitivity, positive predictive value, representativeness, timeliness, and stability can increase the cost of a surveillance system.</p>

A written protocol should guide data and sample collection, with mechanisms to ensure adherence. Data collection methods should be clearly documented, and collection methods should minimize redundancy, address data gaps, and employ appropriate sampling strategies (e.g., risk-based or pooled).</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong> Data collection is a fundamental surveillance activity consistently recognized in evaluation frameworks across public, animal, and One Health systems (five instances within the literature review). Data collection was explicitly mentioned as a concept in the evaluation of surveillance systems in five instances within the literature, including a clear definition and integration into the animal health surveillance field. It is commonly cited as the most costly and difficult component of a surveillance system to implement (Chaudron, 2010; Peyre et al.&nbsp;2022).</p>

Regular submission from all contributors and strong data management practices help improve completeness. Ensuring completeness strengthens data quality.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong> Completeness was identified as an independent concept on 12 occassions, distinct from the definitions of "data quality" or "data completeness and correctness". The concept was first introduced by Thacker et al., in 1988 (A method for evaluating systems of epidemiological surveillance), however it was not indentified as an evaluation concept until 1993 by Cutts et al.&nbsp;The definition of completeness has remained largely unchanged over the years, maintaining consistency across disciplines. It is primarily regarded as a key aspect of data quality and continues to be one of the most frequently used concepts for evaluating surveillance systems.</p>

Electronic systems can enhance data quality by improving accuracy, timeliness, and accessibility. Data quality is linked to terms such as timeliness, acceptability, representativeness, and usefulness, and directly affects the reliability and usability of system outputs for decision-making and public health response.</p>
<strong>Background</strong>
<p>
Data quality has historically been defined by the core attributes of completeness and validity. It is routinely recognized as essential across public health, animal health, and emerging One Health surveillance frameworks. In the context of animal health, the term "data completeness and correctness" is used as an exact synonym for data quality.
</p>
<p>
In more recent years, data quality includes the concept of fit-for-purpose, with sufficeint quality to meet the need of the data’s intended purpose. As surveillance systems evolve, particularly through the use of informatics and electronic systems, data quality is enhanced and expanded. Electronic systems can improve data quality by facilitating accuracy, timeliness, accessibility, and reducing the potential for manual entry errors. As data systems evolve, data quality has been enhanced and expanded with the use of robust data management systems and automated data flow processes. The concept is highly interrelated with other performance metrics; for instance, poor quality data reduces system acceptability and representativeness.
