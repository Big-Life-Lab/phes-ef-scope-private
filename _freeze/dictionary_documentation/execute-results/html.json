It encompasses recognition of the system's importance, satisfaction with processes, trust in data management, perceived reporting burden, and alignment with ethical and cultural expectations. High acceptability is supported by clear communication, demonstrated value, privacy protections, and responsiveness to user needs.\n\n**Background**\nAcceptability was identified as a foundational concept in the evaluation of public health surveillance, being identified on 34 occassions. In our review, the concept was identified as early as 1988, to reflect &quot;the willingness of individuals and organizations to participate in the surveillance system&quot;. Overall, definitions have remained largely congruent with the one introduced in 1988. However, the concept has evolved through the incorporation of new elements such as trust and engagement.\n\n**Synonyms**\n\n- **Exact:** N/A\n- **Broad:** participation\n\n\n***\n## acceptabilityAndEngagement {#acceptabilityandengagement}\n\n\n**ID:** –\n**Label:** Acceptability and engagement\n**See also:** [acceptability](#acceptability); [engagement](#engagement); [collaboration](#collaboration)\n\n**Definition**\nN/A\n\n**Description**\nAcceptability and engagement reflect the willingness to participate in and the degree of involvement with a surveillance system. They are shaped by system design (e.g., simplicity, timeliness), perceived value (e.g., importance, relevance, trust), and social context (e.g., cultural fit, stigma, privacy concerns). High levels of acceptability and engagement improve data quality, sustainability, and stakeholder collaboration but may be limited by political will, resource constraints, and communication barriers.\n\n**Background**\nAcceptability as a surveillance system attribute has evolved since its initial conceptualization. The original CDC 1988 definition focused on willingness of individuals and organizations to participate in surveillance activities. The 2001 CDC guidelines maintained this core concept while expanding factors that influence acceptability. Calba et al. (2015) broadened the concept to include not just willingness but &quot;the degree to which each of these users is involved in the surveillance.&quot; Contemporary understanding has further expanded to encompass community engagment, participation, and trust—reflecting a shift from traditional, top-down surveillance approaches to more collaborative models. This evolution acknowledges that modern surveillance systems must be acceptable to a wider range of stakeholders beyond traditional public health departments, including affected communities, healthcare providers, private sector entities, and various levels of government. The concept now implicitly recognizes cultural appropriateness, and ethical considerations as components of acceptability.\n\n**Synonyms**\n\n- **Exact:** N/A\n- **Broad:** participation\n\n\n***\n## accessibilityData {#accessibilitydata}\n\n\n**ID:** –\n**Label:** Accessibility (data)\n**See also:** data management and storage; [interoperability](#interoperability)\n\n**Definition**\nThe ease with which authorized users can retrieve surveillance data and metadata using standardized protocols.\n\n**Description**\n[To incoporate FAIR in description]. Accessibility in public health surveillance refers to how readily and consistently surveillance outputs (such as alerts, reports, or predictive model results) and input data (such as raw surveillance data or supporting information) are available to end-users, decision-makers, and planners. This includes availability through standardized and sustainable protocols, user-friendly dissemination mechanisms, and manageable data formats. Accessible systems reduce technical, administrative, logistical, and practical barriers, enabling timely decision-making and effective public health responses.\n\n**Background**\nFAIR data concepts, introduced by Yang et al. in 2022, have become increasingly prominent. Definitions of accessibility commonly include providing data “when and how users need them,” although these elements overlap with system availability and communication and dissemination. Accessibility involves both output accessibility (ease of disseminating surveillance results to users) and input accessibility (consistent availability and usability of source data). Effective accessibility also requires sufficient human and technological resources, clear authorization balancing openness with privacy and security, and robust infrastructure for reliable data flow.\n\n**Synonyms**\n\n- **Exact:** N/A\n- **Broad:** N/A\n\n\n***\n## accuracy {#accuracy}\n\n\n**ID:** –\n**Label:** Accuracy\n**See also:** [precision](#precision); bias\n\n**Definition**\nThe proportion of data entries that correctly reflect the true value of the data collected.\n\n**Description**\n[Comparison to the reference standard, ISO,varying definitions]. Accuracy is influenced by several factors, including the sensitivity and specificity of case definitions, the clairty of surveillance forms (whether hardcopy or electronic), the technical competence and training of staff, and the care exercised in data management. It is positively correlated with several other data quality attributes/terms, including representativeness, precision, completeness, and consistency, and is negatively correlated with bias. System acceptability can influence how accurately data are captured and recorded.\n\n**Background**\n<p>Accuracy was identified as an independent concept on eight occassions, distinct from the definitions of &quot;data quality&quot; or &quot;data completeness and correctness&quot;. However, this concept has been defined inconsistently across the literature, with terminology varying by discipline - often referred to as validity, accuracy, or data correctness. The definition of accuracy that we have adopted aligns with the DQO and ISO/IEC 25012 definition.</p>\n<p>The definition aligns with established international standards, including ISO 8000-2:2020, which defines accuracy as the correctness of data relative to real-world conditions. It also corresponds to definitions in the Data Quality Ontology (DQO), which emphasizes accuracy as the correctness and precision with which data represent reality. Accuracy assessment often involves validation procedures, comparisons against reference standards, or independent verification processes.</p>\n\n**Synonyms**\n\n- **Exact:** validity, data correctness, bias (Peyre 2019, 2022), comparability\n- **Broad:** data quality?\n\n\n***\n## adaptability {#adaptability}\n\n\n**ID:** –\n**Label:** Adaptability\n**See also:** N/A\n\n**Definition**\nN/A\n\n**Description**\nN/A\n\n**Background**\n–\n\n**Synonyms**\n\n- **Exact:** Flexibility\n- **Broad:** N/A\n\n\n***\n## adherence {#adherence}\n\n\n**ID:** –\n**Label:** Adherence --- suggest change to \"Standards use\" or \"Standards adherence\"\n**See also:** [compliance](#compliance)\n\n**Definition**\nThe degree to which a surveillance system follows and implements established guidelines, protocols, classification systems, and data exchange standards in its core and supporting functions.\n\n**Description**\nStandardization encompasses adherence to recognized guidelines across multiple dimensions of surveillance systems, including methodological protocols, data structures, classification systems, and exchange formats. This attribute covers both technical standards (data formats, interoperability frameworks) and operational standards (case definitions, reporting procedures).  Standards use is closely related to compliance, but differs in focus. While standards use focuses on internal consistency in following best practices and operational protocols, compliance is centred around relevant legislation, regulations and policies, including ethics and security. Beyond compliance, standards use is also tied to other data quality attributes/terms, and is positively correlated with consistency ans technical competence and training.\n\n**Background**\n<p>The concept of adherence was identified six times in our scoping review. However, the overarching concept referred to here was only identified by Yang et al., (2022), with elements of this definition being referenced multiple times throughout the literature (e.g., standards use, transparency).</p>\n<p>High adherence is essential for the consistent functioning of the system, as it reduces errors, ensures uniformity, and facilitates the accurate tracking of health-related events or environmental changes. A system with high adherence is more likely to produce accurate and high-quality data, as following established protocols reduces errors and inconsistencies. It also enhances consistency by ensuring uniform application of procedures across time and by different personnel. Furthermore, training and supervision play a critical role in maintaining adherence, as they ensure that individuals are well-equipped to follow protocols correctly and consistently.</p>\n\n**Synonyms**\n\n- **Exact:** N/A\n- **Broad:** standards use\n\n\n***\n## availablity {#availablity}\n\n\n**ID:** –\n**Label:** Availability (system)\n**See also:** Accessibility (data); N/A\n\n**Definition**\nThe ability to be operational when needed (Groseclose 2017; Peyre 2019, Peyre 2022; Muellner 2018; Hoinville 2013; Yang 2022; Albali 2023; Amato 2023; Anonymous 2001; Azofeifa 2018; Babaie 2015; Baker 2006; Buehler 2004, 2008; Calba 2015; Drewe 2012, 2015; Harper 2011; Innes 2022; Lucero-Obusan 2022; Marbus 2020; Meynard 2008; Ng'etich 2021; Sosin 2003; Bordier 2019; Velasova 2015).\n\n**Description**\nAvailability reflects a system’s readiness to reliably collect, process, and disseminate surveillance data when required. It encompasses the continuous functioning of essential components, including infrastructure, skilled personnel, and communication channels, ensuring timely public health responses.\n\n**Background**\n–\n\n**Synonyms**\n\n- **Exact:** N/A\n- **Broad:** N/A\n\n\n***\n## benefit {#benefit}\n\n\n**ID:** –\n**Label:** Benefit\n**See also:** [costs](#costs); [impact](#impact)\n\n**Definition**\nThe direct and indirect advantages produced by the surveillance system.\n\n**Description**\n[Carol's + time horizon component]. The benefit term is influenced by several factors, including the scope of surveillance objectives, the effectiveness of data use in decision-making, and the capacity for early detection and response. It encompasses direct and indirect outcomes such as cost savings, improved public and animal health, enhanced trade, and prevention of losses in productivity, morbidity, and mortality. Benefits are positively correlated with terms such as timeliness, usefulness, and stability, and are shaped by stakeholder engagement and collaboration. The distribution of benefits across sectors also informs the overall value of the surveillance system.\n\n**Background**\nBenefit was identified as an independent concept nine times in our scoping review, distinct from related concepts such as costs, impact, and efficiency. The concept was first introduced by Hoinville et al., in 2013 and was consistently included in animal health surveillance system evaluation frameworks thereafter. The definition has remained largely unchanged with the execption of Calba et al., 2015 introducing the idea of assessing whether users are satisfied that their requirements have been met in their definition. Their paper also focused solely on non-monetary benefits. However, despite the alignment of this definition across animal health surveillance evaluation frameworks, benefit was not identified as a standalone concept in the context of public health surveillance.\n\n**Synonyms**\n\n- **Exact:** N/A\n- **Broad:** N/A\n\n\n***\n## biasAscertainmentPerformance {#biasascertainmentperformance}\n\n\n**ID:** –\n**Label:** Bias (ascertainment performance)\n**See also:** [accuracy](#accuracy); [precision](#precision); [sensitivity](#sensitivity); [specificity](#specificity); [representativeness](#representativeness); data quality; predictive value positive; false detection rate\n\n**Definition**\nThe extent to which a prevalence estimate produced by the surveillance system deviates from the true prevalence value.\n\n**Description**\nCase detection bias occurs when systematic measurement errors cause surveillance data to systematically differ from the true occurrence of the health event in the target population. Bias can arise from multiple sources including diagnostic test characteristics, reporting practices, population coverage, sampling methods, case definitions, and temporal factors.\nThe magnitude and impact of bias depends on surveillance objectives. For general population surveillance, bias can distort prevalence estimates and trend analysis, leading to incorrect public health conclusions.\n\n**Background**\n<p>Bias was identified as a reported concept six times in our scoping review. The concept was first introduced by Hoinville et al., in 2013 and was consistently included in animal health surveillance system evaluation frameworks thereafter. The definition has remained largely unchanged with the execption of Peyre 2019 &amp; 2022 incorporating the idea of &quot;bias=accuracy&quot; in their definition. Despite its frequent application in evaluating animal health surveillance systems, the term &quot;bias&quot; was not identified in the context of public health surveillance.</p>\n<p>Evaluating bias in surveillance systems is essential for accurately monitoring endemic diseases.</p>\n\n**Synonyms**\n\n- **Exact:** N/A\n- **Broad:** N/A\n\n\n***\n## caseDefinition {#casedefinition}\n\n\n**ID:** –\n**Label:** Case definition\n**See also:** bias (case detection)\n\n**Definition**\nThe standard set of criteria used to identify and classify cases or events for consistent reporting and analyses within a surveillance system.\n\n**Description**\nThe case definition affects surveillance system performance by determining how accurately and consistently cases are identified and classified. A well-designed case definition supports accurate and consistent detection, improving the quality of the data collected. It directly influences terms like sensitivity, specificity, representativeness, and coverage, and plays a role in determining the system’s cost, acceptability, and flexibility. Clear defined definition may also improve consistency across sites and over time.\n\n**Background**\nThe concept of case definition was identifed five times throughout our scoping review.\n\n**Synonyms**\n\n- **Exact:** N/A\n- **Broad:** N/A\n\n\n***\n## collaboration {#collaboration}\n\n\n**ID:** –\n**Label:** Collaboration\n**See also:** acceptability and engagement; [governance](#governance)\n\n**Definition**\nThe active engagement and coordination among diverse partners and end-users to facilitate exchange of data, information, and knowledge, sharing of capacities, and collaborative implementation of surveillance activities.\n\n**Description**\nCollaboration in surveillance systems relies on clear roles, strong legal frameworks, and established inter-sectoral mechanisms. It occurs in four main areas: governance across sectors (health, animal, environment), decision-making at all levels (local to international), interdisciplinary efforts (biosciences, social sciences, engineering), and public-private partnerships (e.g., veterinary companies in antimicrobial resistance). Effective data exchange and a shared databases enhance collaboration.

Surveillance data outputs must meet the needs of diverse users, including data providers, analysts, decision-makers, and the public. Outputs should be accessible, frequent, and based on up-to-date, high-quality data with clear explanations of limitations and biases. Communication and disseminationis is also closely linked to acceptability, timeliness, impact, and collaboration.\n\n**Background**\nTBD\n\n**Synonyms**\n\n- **Exact:** N/A\n- **Broad:** N/A\n\n\n***\n## compatibility {#compatibility}\n\n\n**ID:** –\n**Label:** Compatability\n**See also:** Coherence; [interoperability](#interoperability)\n\n**Definition**\nCompatibility with and ability to integrate data from other sources and surveillance components, e.g., one health surveillance (part of data collection and data management) (Peyre 2019, Peyre 2022).\n\n**Description**\nN/A\n\n**Background**\n–\n\n**Synonyms**\n\n- **Exact:** N/A\n- **Broad:** Integration\n\n\n***\n## compliance {#compliance}\n\n\n**ID:** –\n**Label:** Compliance\n**See also:** [adherence](#adherence)\n\n**Definition**\nThe degree to which the surveillance system complies with all relevant legislation, regulations and policies, including ethics and confidentiality requirements.\n\n**Description**\nCompliance refers to meeting required legal or regulatory requirements, often with external oversight. It is closely related to adherence, but differs in focus. While compliance focuses on relevant legislation, regulations and policies, including ethics and security, adherence is centred around internal consistency in following best practices and operational protocols. Beyond adherence, compliance is also tied to other data quality attributes/terms, and is positively correlated with consistency ans technical competence and training.\n\n**Background**\nThe concept of compliance was identified twice in our scoping review. However, the overarching concept referred to here was only identified by Yang et al., (2022), with components of this definition being referenced multiple times throughout the literature (e.g., legislative support, security, ethical considerations).\n\n**Synonyms**\n\n- **Exact:** N/A\n- **Broad:** legislative support\n\n\n***\n## consistency {#consistency}\n\n\n**ID:** –\n**Label:** Consistency\n**See also:** N/A\n\n**Definition**\nData have the same meanings (e.g. case definition, diagnosis standards) to allow for consistent interpretation. This includes internal consistency (within a dataset) and external consistency (across different data sources), as well as consistency over time.\n\n**Description**\nConsistency refers to the uniformity and reliability of data across time and sources within the surveillance system. It ensures that data remain unchanged when replicated, transferred, or integrated between partners. Consistent data collection methods, coding systems, case definitions, and documentation of transformations are essential for comparability and trend analysis.\n\n**Background**\nConsistency was identified five times in our scoping review.\n\n**Synonyms**\n\n- **Exact:** N/A\n- **Broad:** repeatability, precision\n\n\n***\n## costBenefit {#costbenefit}\n\n\n**ID:** –\n**Label:** Cost-benefit\n**See also:** cost minimization; [costs](#costs); cost-effectiveness; cost-utility; [benefit](#benefit)\n\n**Definition**\nAn analysis where all costs and outcomes are expressed in monetary terms, calculating the net gain or loss by measuring both the costs of an intervention and the monetary value of its outcomes.\n\n**Description**\nCost-benefit analysis quantifies both the costs and outcomes of a surveillance system in monetary terms to assess its net economic value. This allows comparison of investments against financial benefits such as reduced disease burden, healthcare savings, or productivity gains. It supports decision-making by highlighting the economic return of surveillance activities relative to their expense. Accurate valuation of outcomes and comprehensive cost accounting—including direct, indirect, fixed, and variable costs—are essential. This term complements cost-effectiveness and cost-minimization analyses by providing a broader economic perspective on surveillance system value.\n\n**Background**\nTBD\n\n**Synonyms**\n\n- **Exact:** N/A\n- **Broad:** N/A\n\n\n***\n## costEffectiveness {#costeffectiveness}\n\n\n**ID:** –\n**Label:** Cost-effectiveness\n**See also:** cost minimization; cost-benefit; [costs](#costs); cost-utility; [benefit](#benefit)\n\n**Definition**\nRelationship between the expected outcomes and the costs of surveillance to achieve these outcomes. Surveillance system costs include direct costs (personnel and material resources), indirect costs (resulting from preparedness and response to surveillance findings), and prevention benefits or costs from a societal perspective (e.g., effects of the information generated on decision making and population health). Refers to the relative expenditures (costs) and outcomes (effects) of different surveillance strategies, determining whether the improved health outcomes or surveillance capabilities justify the associated costs to help inform efficient resource allocation decisions (kirsh 2008 adpated for surveillance).\n\n**Description**\nThe costs of obtaining surveillance information needs to be balanced against the benefits derived. Assessment of surveillance resources typically focuses on direct costs. Because of the complexity of surveillance and response processes, it is usually difficult to define indirect costs. For some infectious disease surveillance systems, investigators have modeled the expected future costs of strategies for continued vaccination, surveillance, and other public health activities. Efforts to improve sensitivity, positive predictive value, representativeness, timeliness, and stability can increase the cost of a surveillance system.\n\n**Background**\nTBD\n\n**Synonyms**\n\n- **Exact:** N/A\n- **Broad:** N/A\n\n\n***\n## costMinimization {#costminimization}\n\n\n**ID:** –\n**Label:** Cost minimization\n**See also:** [costs](#costs); cost-benefit; cost-effectiveness; cost-utility; [benefit](#benefit)\n\n**Definition**\nThe comparison of costs between alternatives with identical outcomes, used to determine the most economical option when no additional benefits are present (often applied to demonstrate the dominance of one strategy over another).\n\n**Description**\nCost-minimization compares the expenses of alternative surveillance strategies that achieve identical outcomes to identify the most economical option. It helps prioritize resource allocation by demonstrating which approach delivers the same public health impact at the lowest cost. This term is closely linked to cost-effectiveness and efficiency, but unlike those, it assumes equivalent benefits across options. Accurate cost data—including fixed and variable costs—are essential. Considering operational, personnel, and infrastructure expenses ensures a comprehensive evaluation, supporting sustainable and affordable surveillance system design without compromising performance.\n\n**Background**\nTBD\n\n**Synonyms**\n\n- **Exact:** N/A\n- **Broad:** N/A\n\n\n***\n## costUtility {#costutility}\n\n\n**ID:** –\n**Label:** Cost-utility\n**See also:** cost minimization; cost-benefit; cost-effectiveness; [costs](#costs); [benefit](#benefit)\n\n**Definition**\nAn evaluation that compares the system's interventions or strategies by measuring outcomes in terms of utility gained, using a ratio scale to assess the value of different health states or surveillance outcomes, allowing for comparison across various surveillance approaches and their impact on public health.\n\n**Description**\nCost-utility analysis compares surveillance strategies by measuring outcomes in terms of utility, often using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) or disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). This allows valuation of health benefits considering both quantity and quality of life gained from interventions. It facilitates comparison across diverse surveillance approaches with different health impacts, integrating effectiveness and economic costs into a single metric. Accurate utility measurement requires reliable health state valuation and comprehensive cost data. This term complements cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analyses by focusing on health-related quality of life, supporting informed resource allocation in public health surveillance.\n\n**Background**\nTBD\n\n**Synonyms**\n\n- **Exact:** N/A\n- **Broad:** N/A\n\n\n***\n## costs {#costs}\n\n\n**ID:** –\n**Label:** Costs\n**See also:** cost minimization; cost-benefit; cost-effectiveness; cost-utility; [benefit](#benefit)\n\n**Definition**\nAll expenses associated with the surveillance system, including direct costs (e.g., equipment, personnel) and indirect costs (e.g., training, data management infrastructure).\n\n**Description**\nCost is a key consideration in evaluating surveillance systems, reflecting their value and efficiency. Costs are both direct (e.g., personnel, data collection, laboratory services, infrastructure) and indirect (e.g., follow-up efforts for false alarms, impact on agency credibility). New or improved systems incur start-up (e.g., software, equipment) and ongoing operational costs (e.g., staff, maintenance). Economic analyses should balance these costs with the public health benefits, such as early outbreak detection and disease prevention, to assess overall value. Direct and indirect costs are usually collected and reported separately.\n\n**Background**\nTBD\n\n**Synonyms**\n\n- **Exact:** N/A\n- **Broad:** N/A\n\n\n***\n## coverage {#coverage}\n\n\n**ID:** –\n**Label:** Coverage\n**See also:** [representativeness](#representativeness)\n\n**Definition**\nProportion of the population of interest (target population) or proportion of areas of interest (e.g. specific habitats or high- risk sites) that is included in the surveillance activity.\n\n**Description**\nCoverage indicates the extent to which the target population or geographic areas are included in surveillance. High coverage enhances representativeness, sensitivity, and early detection—especially for emerging threats. It is related to sampling strategy, reporting completeness, and access to high-risk populations. Mathematically, coverage is the proportion the same represents divided by the total target population size.\n\n**Background**\nCoverage was identified as a reported concept six times in our scoping review. The concept was first introduced by Hoinville et al., in 2013 and has since been consistently included in animal health surveillance system evaluation frameworks. The definition has remained highly consistent within animal health surveillance, aligning with the concept of &quot;population coverage&quot; in public health surveillance.\n\n**Synonyms**\n\n- **Exact:** N/A\n- **Broad:** representativeness?\n\n\n***\n## credibilityCollaboration {#credibilitycollaboration}\n\n\n**ID:** –\n**Label:** Credibility (collaboration)\n**See also:** N/A\n\n**Definition**\nN/A\n\n**Description**\nTBD\n\n**Background**\nTBD\n\n**Synonyms**\n\n- **Exact:** N/A\n- **Broad:** N/A\n\n\n***\n## credibilityData {#credibilitydata}\n\n\n**ID:** –\n**Label:** Credibility (data)\n**See also:** N/A\n\n**Definition**\nN/A\n\n**Description**\nTBD\n\n**Background**\nTBD\n\n**Synonyms**\n\n- **Exact:** N/A\n- **Broad:** N/A\n\n\n***\n## dataAccessibility {#dataaccessibility}\n\n\n**ID:** –\n**Label:** Data accessibility\n**See also:** N/A\n\n**Definition**\n–\n\n**Description**\nN/A\n\n**Background**\n–\n\n**Synonyms**\n\n- **Exact:** Accessibility (data)\n- **Broad:** –\n\n\n***\n## dataAnalysis {#dataanalysis}\n\n\n**ID:** –\n**Label:** Data analysis\n**See also:** data collection; data management and storage\n\n**Definition**\nThe use of appropriate methods for the analysis and interpretation of data.\n\n**Description**\nData analysis applies scientific methods to process surveillance data to generate insights such as detecting unusual patterns (i.e. outbreaks, signal levels beyond expected). Methods range from basic descriptive statistics and trend monitoring to more sophisticated approaches like time series, spatial analysis, and automated aberration detection algorithms.  <del>assesses how effectively surveillance data are processed and interpreted to generate insights.</del> High-performing systems apply appropriate, context-specific analytical methods and ensure findings are actionable.\n\n**Background**\nData analysis was cited as a concept in surveillance system evaluation nine times in the literature, spanning public health, animal health, and One Health surveillance system evaluation frameworks. The definition remains largely consistent, relfecting uniformity across disciplines, with refinment over time, to emphasize the use of contextual information (e.g., prior likelihood of disease) in risk-based analysis and the need for analysis/interpretation to be performed timely to support decision-making and action.\n\n**Synonyms**\n\n- **Exact:** N/A\n- **Broad:** N/A\n\n\n***\n## dataCollection {#datacollection}\n\n\n**ID:** –\n**Label:** Data collection\n**See also:** data analysis; data management and storage\n\n**Definition**\nThe use of appropriate data sources and collection methods, including a clear a case definition and a data collection protocol.\n\n**Description**\nEffective data collection relies on clearly defined and complete case definitions or risk organism descriptions, including case signalment, clinical and pathological signs, and epidemiological information, and, where relevant, laboratory or taxonomic identification. Diagnostic methods must align with the case definition and be assessed for sensitivity and specificity. A written protocol should guide data and sample collection, with mechanisms to ensure adherence. Data collection methods should be clearly documented, and collection methods should minimize redundancy, address data gaps, and employ appropriate sampling strategies (e.g., risk-based or pooled).\n\n**Background**\nData collection is a fundamental surveillance activity consistently recognized in evaluation frameworks across public, animal, and One Health systems (five instances within the literature review). Data collection was explicitly mentioned as a concept in the evaluation of surveillance systems in five instances within the literature, including a clear definition and integration into the animal health surveillance field. It is commonly cited as the most costly and difficult component of a surveillance system to implement (Chaudron, 2010; Peyre et al. 2022).\n\n**Synonyms**\n\n- **Exact:** N/A\n- **Broad:** N/A\n\n\n***\n## dataCompleteness {#datacompleteness}\n\n\n**ID:** –\n**Label:** Data completeness\n**See also:** [coverage](#coverage); [accuracy](#accuracy)\n\n**Definition**\nThe proportion of data that were intended to be collected that actually was collected.\n\n**Description**\nCompleteness refers to the extent to which all required data are captured, reported, and available for analysis. A system with high completeness allows for more reliable decision-making and enhances the system's usefulness. Incomplete data may result from issues with data collection, management, or communication, undermining the system's effectiveness. Regular submission from all contributors and strong data management practices help improve completeness. Ensuring completeness strengthens data quality.\n\n**Background**\nCompleteness was identified as an independent concept on 12 occassions, distinct from the definitions of &quot;data quality&quot; or &quot;data completeness and correctness&quot;. The concept was first introduced by Thacker et al., in 1988 (A method for evaluating systems of epidemiological surveillance), however it was not indentified as an evaluation concept until 1993 by Cutts et al. The definition of completeness has remained largely unchanged over the years, maintaining consistency across disciplines. It is primarily regarded as a key aspect of data quality and continues to be one of the most frequently used concepts for evaluating surveillance systems.\n\n**Synonyms**\n\n- **Exact:** data completeness and correctness (completeness)\n- **Broad:** N/A\n\n\n***\n## dataCorrectness {#datacorrectness}\n\n\n**ID:** –\n**Label:** Data correctness\n**See also:** N/A\n\n**Definition**\nThe proportion of data entries that correctly reflect the true value of the data collected.\n\n**Description**\nN/A - data completeness and correctness is an exact synonym for data quality.\n\n**Background**\nTBD\n\n**Synonyms**\n\n- **Exact:** accuracy (correctness), completeness, data quality\n- **Broad:** N/A\n\n\n***\n## dataManagement {#datamanagement}\n\n\n**ID:** –\n**Label:** Data management\n**See also:** N/A\n\n**Definition**\n–\n\n**Description**\n–\n\n**Background**\n–\n\n**Synonyms**\n\n- **Exact:** –\n- **Broad:** –\n\n\n***\n## dataManagementAndStorage {#datamanagementandstorage}\n\n\n**ID:** –\n**Label:** Data management and storage\n**See also:** historical data\n\n**Definition**\nAppropriate use and documentation of data management systems for processing information, including data processing protocols, and effective use of data verification procedures and of data storage and back-up procedures.\n\n**Description**\n<p>Appropriate use and documentation of data management systems for processing information, including data processing protocols and effective use of data verification procedures, data storage and back-up protocols.

Conversely, high-quality data are essential for accurate analysis and improving the system's overall usefulness for decision-making and public health action.  <del>High-quality data improve system acceptability and representativeness, while</del> Poor-quality data—often due to manual entry errors in paper-based systems—can undermine reliability and may indicate problems in data collection or data management and storage. Electronic systems can enhance data quality by improving accuracy, timeliness, and accessibility. Data quality is linked to terms such as timeliness, acceptability, representativeness, and usefulness, and directly affects the reliability and usability of system outputs for decision-making and public health response.\n\n**Background**\n<p>Data quality has historically been defined by the core attributes of completeness and validity. It is routinely recognized as essential across public health, animal health, and emerging One Health surveillance frameworks.  In the context of animal health, the term &quot;data completeness and correctness&quot; is used as an exact synonym for data quality.</p>\n<p>In more recent years, data quality includes the concept of fit-for-purpose, with sufficeint quality to meet the need of the data's intended purpose.  As surveillance systems evolve, particularly through the use of informatics and electronic systems, data quality is enhanced and expanded. Electronic systems can improve data quality by facilitating accuracy, timeliness, accessibility, and reducing the potential for manual entry errors. As data systems evolve, data quality has been enhanced and expanded with the use of robust data management systems and automated data flow processes. The concept is highly interrelated with other performance metrics; for instance, poor quality data reduces system acceptability and representativeness.</p>\n\n**Synonyms**\n\n- **Exact:** data completeness and correctness\n- **Broad:** N/A\n\n\n***\n## detectionMode {#detectionmode}\n\n\n**ID:** –\n**Label:** Detection mode\n**See also:** N/A\n\n**Definition**\nThe operational capability of the surveillance system to identify or forecast an event (e.g., event detection, establish baseline, or event detection expected with no baseline).\n\n**Description**\nFor example, are events detected that deviate from the established baseline in frequency and/or magnitude? It should be noted that the baseline fluctuates and that any excess or anomalous occurrence should be statistically characterized and should include some measure of abnormality or confidence\n\n**Background**\nTBD\n\n**Synonyms**\n\n- **Exact:** N/A\n- **Broad:** N/A\n\n\n***\n## effectiveness {#effectiveness}\n\n\n**ID:** –\n**Label:** Effectiveness\n**See also:** [usefulness](#usefulness)\n\n**Definition**\nThe extent to which a surveillance system is able to achieve its intended objectives.\n\n**Description**\nEffectiveness reflects how well the surveillance system achieves its intended objectives and meets the needs of stakeholders. It considers factors such as timeliness, sensitivity, specificity, predictive value, and robustness. Systems should use collaborative approaches to improve effectiveness across data collection, processing, and dissemination. Indicators may include task completion, timeliness, and measurable public health impact. This term is closely related to both system usefulness and efficiency.\n\n**Background**\nTBD\n\n**Synonyms**\n\n- **Exact:** efficacy\n- **Broad:** N/A\n\n\n***\n## efficiency {#efficiency}\n\n\n**ID:** –\n**Label:** Efficiency\n**See also:** N/A\n\n**Definition**\nThe link between the resources implemented and the results obtained.\n\n**Description**\nAn efficient system will accomplish a job with minimum expenditure of time, human effort and cost. Conducting surveillance incurs costs such as salaries, consumables, and travel. These costs can be compared against the outputs from surveillance such as reports, disease or organism detections and notifications, or other signals. A surveillance system can be considered efficient if there is an optimal balance between economic investments and its outputs, the latter achieving the desired quality attributes (e.g. precision, timeliness). Risk-based surveillance can - where appropriate in terms of the surveillance objective - provide efficiency gains in surveillance systems.\n\n**Background**\nTBD\n\n**Synonyms**\n\n- **Exact:** N/A\n- **Broad:** cost-effectiveness\n\n\n***\n## engagement {#engagement}\n\n\n**ID:** –\n**Label:** Engagement\n**See also:** [acceptability](#acceptability); [collaboration](#collaboration)\n\n**Definition**\nThe active involvement of stakeholders, including partners and communities, in the design, operation, interpretation, and use of the surveillance system.\n\n**Description**\nEngagement reflects the depth and quality of participation in surveillance activities. It encompasses contributions to data collection, system design, analysis interpretation, and application of surveillance outputs. Effective engagement is characterized by meaningful interaction, shared responsibility, and mutual benefit among all partners.\n\n**Background**\nThe concept of engagement has evolved in surveillance practice, particularly in emphasizing community involvement. Engaged communities participate in various aspects of surveillance, from identifying priorities to collecting data and using results. Evidence of engagement includes consistent participation, valuable feedback, system adaptation based on community input, and local ownership of activities. Modern approaches recognize that engagement should include diverse communities, especially those most affected by health conditions under surveillance. This shift values equitable partnerships where communities are active collaborators rather than simply sources of data.\n\n**Synonyms**\n\n- **Exact:** participation\n- **Broad:** –\n\n\n***\n## equityData {#equitydata}\n\n\n**ID:** –\n**Label:** Equity data\n**See also:** data collection\n\n**Definition**\nWhether race/ethnicity data, measures of racism, and valid stigma indicators are captaured by the data collection of a surveillance system.\n\n**Description**\nTBD\n\n**Background**\nTBD\n\n**Synonyms**\n\n- **Exact:** TBD\n- **Broad:** TBD\n\n\n***\n## falseAlarmRate {#falsealarmrate}\n\n\n**ID:** –\n**Label:** False-alarm rate\n**See also:** [specificity](#specificity)\n\n**Definition**\nThe proportion of negative events (e.g. non-outbreak periods) incorrectly classified as events (outbreaks).\n\n**Description**\nThe false-alarm rate is the proportion of non-events incorrectly flagged as events, and is the inverse of specificity. While some false positives are expected, a high rate can lead to wasted resources, meanwhile a low rate may indicate poor sensitivity, risking missed outbreaks. Therefore, the proportion of false alarms (i.e., false positives) should be balanced with sensitivity, and assessed with respect to overall sensitivity.This term is positively correlated with sensitivity and cost and should be evaluated alongside overall specificity.\n\n**Background**\nTBD\n\n**Synonyms**\n\n- **Exact:** N/A\n- **Broad:** N/A\n\n\n***\n## feasibility {#feasibility}\n\n\n**ID:** –\n**Label:** Feasibility\n**See also:** [sustainability](#sustainability)\n\n**Definition**\nSurveillance strategies and methods are suitable and applicable to the surveillance objectives and available resources.\n\n**Description**\nFeasibility evaluates whether a surveillance system is realistic and sustainable given available resources, expertise, and objectives. It considers whether system strategies align with public health priorities and if necessary external resources (e.g., committees, affiliations) are in place. The capability of staff, including multidisciplinary expertise, is essential for system operation and maintenance. Feasibility also assesses the ability to track surveillance events over time using available data sources and whether the resources are sufficient to support all system components (data collection, analysis, dissemination) effectively and efficiently.\n\n**Background**\nTBD\n\n**Synonyms**\n\n- **Exact:** N/A\n- **Broad:** N/A\n\n\n***\n## flexibility {#flexibility}\n\n\n**ID:** –\n**Label:** Flexibility\n**See also:** [portability](#portability)\n\n**Definition**\nThe ability of the system to adapt to changing information needs or operating conditions, including scaling up or down as necessary, with little additional time, personnel, or funds.\n\n**Description**\nFlexibility is the system’s ability to adapt to new information needs, emerging threats, or changing resources with minimal disruption. This may involve modifying data sources, case definitions, or reporting mechanisms. Standardized formats and modular designs support flexibility.
