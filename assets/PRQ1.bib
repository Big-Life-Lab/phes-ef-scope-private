  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a major challenge to ending TB occurrence by 2035. In Yemen, the 2011 survey showed an MDR-TB prevalence of 1.4\% among new cases and 14.4\% among previously treated cases. The National Tuberculosis Control Program (NTCP) established four MDR-TB sentinel surveillance sites in 2013 to monitor the MDR-TB situation. In Yemen, the 2011 survey showed an MDR-TB prevalence of 1.4\% among new cases and 14.4\% among previously treated cases. The NTCP established four MDR-TB sentinel surveillance sites in 2013 to monitor the MDR-TB situation., OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the performance of MDR-TB surveillance and determine its strengths and weaknesses., METHODS: We used the updated Center for Diseases Control and Prevention guidelines for evaluating public health surveillance systems. Interviews were conducted with NTCP managers and Regional MDR-TB centers' staff using a semistructured questionnaire. We used a 5-point Likert scale to assess the usefulness and other attributes (eg, simplicity and flexibility). The mean percentage was calculated for each attribute and used for the final rank of the performance: poor ({$<$}60\%), average (60\%-80\%), and good ({$>$}80\%)., RESULTS: The MDR-TB surveillance system achieved good performance in usefulness (87\%), acceptability (82\%), and data quality (91\%); average performance in flexibility (61\%) and simplicity (72\%); and poor performance in stability (55\%). The overall performance score was average (74\%). Although strong commitment, good monitoring, and well-trained staff are the main strengths, depending on an external fund is a major weakness along with unavailability of the MDR-TB unit at the governorate level., CONCLUSIONS: Although the MDR-TB surveillance system has achieved an average overall performance, more efforts are required to improve its stability by ensuring constant power supply to enable laboratories to perform necessary diagnostic and follow-up tests. Gradual replacement of donors' funds by the government is recommended. Scaling up of MDR-TB services and removing access barriers are crucial.

Resource- and time-intensive surveys have been a primary data source to monitor the workforce. We evaluated an administrative data source containing US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) aggregate federal civil service workforce-related data to determine its potential as a workforce surveillance system for this component of the workforce., METHODS: We accessed FedScope, a publicly available online database containing federal administrative civilian HHS personnel data. Using established guidelines for evaluating surveillance systems and identified workforce characteristics, we evaluated FedScope attributes for workforce surveillance purposes., RESULTS: We determined FedScope to be a simple, highly accepted, flexible, stable, and timely system to support analyses of federal civil service workforce-related data. Data can be easily accessed, analyzed, and monitored for changes across years and draw conclusions about the workforce. FedScope data can be used to calculate demographics (eg, sex, race or ethnicity, age group, and education level), employment characteristics (ie, supervisory status, work schedule, and appointment type), retirement projections, and characterize the federal workforce into standard occupational categories., CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that an administrative data source containing HHS personnel data can function as a workforce surveillance system valuable to researchers, public health leaders, and decision makers interested in the federal civil service public health workforce. Using administrative data for workforce development is a model that can be applicable to federal and nonfederal public health agencies and ultimately support improvements in public health.

  abstract = {Few low and middle-income countries (LMIC) have fully operational pharmacovigilance structures, systems and legal framework to collect and collate safety data and evaluate the risks and benefits by active and passive approaches. However, in a LMIC such as Sierra Leone, the capacity to manage the risks by taking appropriate preventative actions to help inform therapeutic decisions, promote rational use of medicines, guide risk management and communications is gradually growing but yet to be fully optimized. This study sought to assess the current status of pharmacovigilance in Sierra Leone since it became the 87th member of the World Health Organisation International Drug Monitoring Programme. This study evaluated the pharmacovigilance system in Sierra Leone through a comprehensive and system-based approach that covered the national medicines regulatory authority, health facilities and public health programmes. A descriptive cross-sectional study design was employed. Using a convenience sampling method, 14 respondents from the national medicines regulatory authority, six health facilities and six public health programmes were interviewed. Data were collected using a validated metric instrument: Indicator-Based Pharmacovigilance Assessment Tool. A scoring system was used for the quantification of assessment results with a score greater than 60\% indicating that an organization has structural and policy frameworks to collect and collate safety data in a national database and evaluate the risks and benefits by both active and passive approaches. The study findings showed that the national medicines regulatory authority scored 79\% and thus met the standard requirements of pharmacovigilance. On the other hand, the health facilities and public health programmes scored less than 60\% indicating the need to fully operationalise pharmacovigilance frameworks at these levels. The study further demonstrated that the national medicine regulatory authority which hosts the national pharmacovigilance centre had functional pharmacovigilance structures and processes with potential to providing leadership in the implementation of pharmacovigilance in Sierra Leone.},

We aimed to establish a syndromic surveillance system to describe the number and type of visits at 2 emergency health-care settings in the same hospital system in Ponce, Puerto Rico. Methods:We implemented a hurricane surveillance system by interviewing patients with a short questionnaire about the reason for visit at a hospital emergency department and associated urgent care clinic in the 6 mo after Hurricane Maria. We then evaluated the system by comparing findings with data from the electronic medical record (EMR) system for the same time period. Results:The hurricane surveillance system captured information from 5116 participants across the 2 sites, representing 17\% of all visits captured in the EMR for the same period. Most visits were associated with acute illness/symptoms (79\%), followed by injury (11\%). The hurricane surveillance and EMR data were similar, proportionally, by sex, age, and visit category. Conclusions:The hurricane surveillance system provided timely and representative data about the number and type of visits at 2 sites. This system, or an adapted version using available electronic data, should be considered in future disaster settings.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision (VMMC) is an effective method for HIV prevention and the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended its expansion in 14 African countries with a high prevalence of HIV and low prevalence of male circumcision. The WHO has recently pre-qualified the PrePex device, a non-surgical male circumcision device, which reduces procedure time, can increase acceptability of VMMC, and can expand the set of potential provider cadres. The PrePex device was introduced in Zimbabwe as a way to scale-up VMMC services in the country. With the rapid scale-up of the PrePex device, as well as other similar devices, a strong surveillance system to detect adverse events (AE) is needed to monitor the safety profile of these devices. We performed a systems-based evaluation of the PrePex device AE active surveillance system in Zimbabwe., METHODS: The evaluation was based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Updated Guidelines for Evaluating Public Health Surveillance Systems. We adapted these guidelines to fit our local context. The evaluation incorporated the review of the standard operating procedures and surveillance system documents. Additionally, structured, in-person interviews were performed with key stakeholders who were users of the surveillance system at various levels. These key stakeholders were from the Ministry of Health, implementing partners, and health facilities in Harare., RESULTS: Clients were requested to return to the facility for follow-up on days 7, 14 and 49 after placement of the device. In the event of a severe AE, a standard report was generated by the health facility and relayed to the Ministry of Health Child and Care and donor agencies through predefined channels within 24 hours of diagnosis. Clinic staff reported difficulties with the amount of documentation required to follow up with clients and to report AEs. The surveillance system's acceptability among users interviewed was high, and users were motivated to identify all possible AEs related to this device. The surveillance system was purely paper-based and both duplicate and discrepant reporting forms between sites were identified., CONCLUSION: The PrePex AE active surveillance system was well accepted among participants in the health system. However, the amount of documentation which was required to follow-up with patients was a major barrier within the system, and might lead to decreased timeliness and quality of reporting. A passive surveillance system supported by electronic reporting would improve acceptance of the program.},

  abstract = {Objective: Leprosy is a chronic, infectious disease complicated with blindness and loss of fingers/toes in some cases. Though the disease is targeted for eradication in Nigeria, the country had the 6th highest prevalence globally in 2013. This study was conducted to evaluate the leprosy surveillance system in Kwara State, assessing its operations, attributes and determining its usefulness. Method(s): The 2001 updated guidelines for evaluating public health systems of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was used. Key informant interviews were done with the State Tuberculosis and Leprosy (TBL) Control Officer, and the State Epidemiologists to assess the importance of the public health, purpose and operation of the surveillance system, resources used to operate it as well as the attributes of the system. Questionnaires were administered to Local Government Area TBL supervisors to assess the attributes of the surveillance system. Surveillance data from 2010 to 2014 was analyzed and data quality determined. Result(s): Incidence of leprosy over the five year period 2010-2014 was 62.0\%, 59.0\%, 54.0\%, 67.0\%, and 42.0\% respectively, with occurrence of the multi-bacillary type in 83.1\% to 90.7\% newly detected cases. The system was found to be 51.0\% sensitive(most hospitals do not have treatment forms for health workers use, community awareness programmes was done in 53.0\% of local government areas in last 3 months, contact tracing was however always done), 90.0\% simple, 93.0\% acceptable and 95.0\% timely. Data system was both paper and electronics, based on collection, collation, analysis and reporting done quarterly in a year. The surveillance system is donor-driven and fully integrated with that of tuberculosis and buruli ulcer. Annual surveillance expenditure was about \$2 500. Conclusion(s): Kwara State Leprosy Surveillance System has a low sensitivity with delayed case detection. Training of health workers on early case detection, provision of treatment forms and more community awareness will improve the surveillance system's sensitivity.},

  abstract = {Background: Acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) is a clinical syndrome with infectious and non-infectious causes. AFP surveillance is the gold standard for detection of poliomyelitis cases and surveillance during polio outbreaks. Ondo state AFP surveillance system was evaluated to describe the key attributes and the process of operation, to determine the efficiency and effectiveness of the surveillance system and to make appropriate recommendations for improving the surveillance system. Methods \& Materials: The evaluation was conducted using the Center for Disease Control and prevention (CDC) Updated Guidelines for Evaluating Public Health Surveillance System, 2001". The evaluation included interview of stakeholders, review of relevant document and resource materials and the analysis of 2009 - 2013 data from the Ondo state AFP surveillance system. Result(s): The AFP surveillance system in Ondo State is simple, flexible and sensitive (annualized NPAFP rate of 3.8/100,000 children less than 15 years in 2009, 4.0/100,000 in 2010, 4.3/100,000 in 2011, 4.1/100,000 in 2012 and 6.4/100,000 in 2013). The system is representative, stable and generates high quality data (97\%, 98\%, 97\%, 98\% and 99\% from 2009-2013. Partner agencies provided 90 - 95\% of the system's operating resources. The system is acceptable to stakeholders but has a low positive predictive value (1.2\% cumulatively from 2009 to 2013). The state has however not recorded any case of WPV since 2010. Conclusion(s): Findings from the evaluation revealed that the AFP surveillance system in the state is meeting its set objectives of detecting Wild Polio Virus (WPV) and identifying areas with continued risk forWPVtransmission. The data quality was good but the resources to maintain the system are inadequate at the state and the LGA levels. The state and local government authorities' ownership of the initiative need to be improved.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Cholera is an acute illness characterized by profuse watery diarrhea. It is caused by vibrio cholera subgroup 01 and 0139. Rapid administration of fluid replacement therapy and supportive treatment can reduce mortality to around 1\%. By the close of 2011, 10,628 cases and 100 deaths were reported in Ghana with a case fatality rate of 0.99. It is important to evaluate the cholera surveillance system in Ghana to determine if it is meeting its objective., METHODS: The study was conducted in Osu Klottey district in the Accra Metropolitan area in January 2014. We assessed the operations (attributes and performance) of the surveillance system for cholera using CDC guidelines (2001). Surveillance data records at the district level from 2011-2013 were extracted and analyzed for frequency using Microsoft excel. Stakeholders and key informants were interviewed using structured questionnaire. Records were also reviewed at some health facilities and at district levels., RESULTS: In 2011 and 2012, case fatality rates (1.3\% and 0.65\%) respectively. Males were mostly affected. The most affected age group was 20-29. In 2011, Predictive value positive was 69.2\% and 50\% in 2012.Cholera peaked in March 2011 and April 2012. The Government of Ghana funded the system. The system is sensitive, simple, stable, flexible, acceptable and representative. It was also useful and data quality was relatively good. Predictive Value Positive was also good., CONCLUSION: The surveillance system is achieving its set out objectives. The system is sensitive, simple, stable, flexible, and acceptable. Predictive value positive was good.},

The objective of this study was to evaluate the reporting completeness and timeliness of the IDSR system at the sub-national level in northern Ghana., METHODS: This was an observational study in Upper East Region (UER). Weekly and monthly disease surveillance reports on completeness and timeliness were downloaded and analysed for 2012 and 2013 from the DHIMS2 in UER, the two Kassena-Nankana districts and their nine health facilities representing public, private and mission providers. Comparison of paper-based and DHIMS2 reporting from the periphery health facilities were assessed., RESULTS: IDSR monthly reporting completeness and timeliness in UER increased by 9\% and 37\% respectively in 2013 compared to 2012 and weekly completeness and timeliness improved by 79\% and 24\% respectively in 2013. Similar reporting increases were seen in the districts and health facilities over the same period, except the Kassena-Nankana Municipal which showed decrease of 2\% in monthly completeness for 2013. At the health facilities, the paper-based reporting completeness was 96\% and timeliness 45\% while DHIMS2 completeness was 83\% and timeliness 18\% in 2012. However, DHIMS2 reporting completeness and timeliness improved in 2013 reaching 100\% and 61\% respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Disease surveillance reporting through DHIMS2 became more complete over time, but there remain problems with timeliness. Surveillance data need to be timely to enable rapid responses to disease outbreaks.},

The Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy was developed and adopted in 1998 for Africa as a comprehensive public health approach and subsequently, Ghana adopted the IDSR technical guidelines in 2002. Since 2012, the IDSR data is reported through the new District Health Information Management System II (DHIMS2) network. The objective was to evaluate the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) system in northern Ghana., METHODS: This was an observational study using mixed methods. Weekly and monthly IDSR data on selected infectious diseases were downloaded and analyzed for 2011, 2012 and 2013 (the years before, of and after DHIMS2 implementation) from the DHIMS2 databank for the Upper East Region (UER) and for two districts of UER. In addition, key informant interviews were conducted among local and regional health officers on the functioning of the IDSR., RESULTS: Clinically diagnosed malaria was the most prevalent disease in UER, with an annual incidence rate close to 1. Around 500 suspected HIV/AIDS cases were reported each year. The highest incidence of cholera and meningitis was reported in 2012 (257 and 392 cases respectively). Three suspected cases of polio and one suspected case of guinea worm were reported in 2013. None of the polio and guinea worm cases and only a fraction of the reported cases of the other diseases were confirmed. A major observation was the large and inconclusive difference in reported cases when comparing weekly and monthly reports. This can be explained by the different reporting practice for the sub-systems. Other challenges were low priority for surveillance, ill-equipped laboratories, rare supervision and missing feedback., CONCLUSIONS: The DHIMS2 has improved the availability of IDSR reports, but the quality of data reported is not sufficient. Particularly the inconsistencies between weekly and monthly data need to be addressed. Moreover, support for and communication within the IDSR system is inadequate and calls for attention.}

The system improved management of TB/HIV co-infections. The average time taken to confirm a suspected TB case was one day. The registration of a confirmed case and subsequent treatment happen immediately after confirmation. The municipality detected 109 of 727 TB cases in 2015 (case detection rate=15\%). The positive predictive value (PPV) was 6.4\%. There was one diagnostic centre in the municipality. Private facilities involvement in TB surveillance activities was low (1/15)., CONCLUSION: The Tuberculosis surveillance system in the Ga West Municipality is well structured but partially meeting its objectives. The system is timely, stable and acceptable by most stakeholders and useful at all levels. It has no major data quality issues. Private health facilities in the municipality should be well incorporated into TB surveillance., FUNDING: This work was supported by Ghana Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program (GFELTP), University of Ghana through the support of the West Africa Health Organization (Ref.: Prog/A17IEpidemSurveillNdegree 57212014/mcrt) to B-YA.

  abstract = {It is now widely acknowledged that surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) must adopt a "One Health" (OH) approach to successfully address the significant threats this global public health issue poses to humans, animals, and the environment. While many protocols exist for the evaluation of surveillance, the specific aspect of the integration of a OH approach into surveillance systems for AMR and antimicrobial Use (AMU), suffers from a lack of common and accepted guidelines and metrics for its monitoring and evaluation functions. This article presents a conceptual framework to evaluate the integration of OH in surveillance systems for AMR and AMU, named the Integrated Surveillance System Evaluation framework (ISSE framework). The ISSE framework aims to assist stakeholders and researchers who design an overall evaluation plan to select the relevant evaluation questions and tools. The framework was developed in partnership with the Canadian Integrated Program for Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance (CIPARS). It consists of five evaluation components, which consider the capacity of the system to: [1] integrate a OH approach, [2] produce OH information and expertise, [3] generate actionable knowledge, [4] influence decision-making, and [5] positively impact outcomes. For each component, a set of evaluation questions is defined, and links to other available evaluation tools are shown. The ISSE framework helps evaluators to systematically assess the different OH aspects of a surveillance system, to gain comprehensive information on the performance and value of these integrated efforts, and to use the evaluation results to refine and improve the surveillance of AMR and AMU globally.},

Despite the multiple interventions implemented to control malaria in the Volta Region, prevalence still remains high. We evaluated the system in Adaklu District, Volta Region to determine if the system is meeting its objectives of monitoring trends, and detecting epidemics, and assessed its usefulness and attributes. Methods \& Materials: We extracted and reviewed malaria data from District Health Management Information System II covering the period of January 2014 and December 2018. We interviewed stakeholders using semi-structured questionnaire on their awareness and involvement in the system, case detection and reporting. System attributes were assessed using the CDC updated guidelines for evaluating public health surveillance. We performed summary descriptive statistics on quantitative data and directed content analysis on qualitative data. Result(s): Of a total 76,384 suspected malaria cases recorded in Adaklu District over the five-year period, 27,498 (57.4\%) cases were recorded between March and October. Health care workers demonstrated good knowledge about the disease but had no idea about the IDSR case definition. All fifteen facilities reported malaria data each month. Stakeholders demonstrated no difficulty diagnosing and reporting cases. The average estimated predictive value positive was 62.9\%, data quality was 95\% and 100\% timely for report submission. The system was used to monitor morbidity trends and evaluate control and preventive measures. There were no alert or epidemic thresholds to detect epidemics. The system missed an epidemic in August 2016. Conclusion(s): The system in Adaklu District was useful, simple, acceptable, representative with good data quality. Seasonal pattern was observed between March and October each year. The district needs to implement Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention especially among children to help reduce the incidence among children under five years. We assisted them to set alert and epidemic thresholds based on past data.Copyright {\copyright} 2020},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Pre-immigration tuberculosis (TB) screening, followed by post-arrival rescreening during the first year, is critical to reducing TB among foreign-born people in the United States. However, existing U.S. public health surveillance is inadequate to monitor TB among immigrants during subsequent years. We developed and tested a novel method for ascertaining post-U.S.-arrival TB outcomes among high-TB-risk immigrant cohorts to improve surveillance., METHODS: We used a probabilistic record linkage program to link pre-immigration screening records from U.S.-bound immigrants from the Philippines (n=422,593) and Vietnam (n=214,401) with the California TB registry during 2000-2010. We estimated sensitivity using Monte Carlo simulations to account for uncertainty in key inputs. Specificity was evaluated by using a time-stratified approach, which defined false-positives as TB records linked to pre-immigration screening records dated after the person had arrived in the United States., RESULTS: TB was reported in 4,382 and 2,830 people born in the Philippines and Vietnam, respectively, in California during the study period. Of these TB cases, records for 973 and 452 cases of people born in the Philippines and Vietnam, respectively, were linked to pre-immigration screening records. Sensitivity and specificity of linkage were 89\% (90\% credible interval [CrI] 83, 97) and 100\%, respectively, for the Philippines, and 90\% (90\% CrI 83, 98) and 99.9\%, respectively, for Vietnam., CONCLUSION: Electronic linkage of pre-immigration screening records to a domestic TB registry was feasible, sensitive, and highly specific in two high-priority immigrant cohorts. Transnational record linkage can be used for program evaluation and routine monitoring of post-U.S.-arrival TB risk among immigrants, but requires interagency data sharing and collaboration.}

  abstract = {Background: The Neonatal Tetanus Surveillance System (NTSS) in Yemen was established in 2009 to identify high-risk areas, determine trends, and evaluate elimination activities. Since its launch, the NTSS had never been evaluated. Objective: This study aimed to assess the performance of NTSS and determine its strengths and weaknesses to recommend improvements. Methods: The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines were used for evaluating the NTSS. Stakeholders at the central, district, and facility levels were interviewed to rate the attributes of the NTSS. The percentage scores for attributes were ranked as poor ({$<$}60\%), average ({$\geq$}60\% to {$<$}80\%) and good ({$\geq$}80\%). Results: The overall usefulness score percentage was 38\%, which indicates a poor performance. The performance of the NTSS was rated as average on flexibility (score percent: 68\%) and acceptability (score percent: 64\%) attributes and poor on stability (score percentage: 33\%), simplicity (score percentage: 57\%), and representativeness (score percentage: 39\%) attributes. About 65\% of investigation forms were completed within 48 hours of notification date. Data quality was poor, as 41\% of the core variables were missing. Conclusions: The overall performance of the NTSS was poor. Most of the system attributes require improvement, including stability, simplicity, quality of data, and completeness of investigation. To improve the performance of NTSS, the following are recommended: capacity building of staff (focal points), strengthening NTSS through technical support and government funding to ensure its sustainability, establishing electronic investigation forms for improving the system data quality, and expansion of NTSS coverage to include all private health care facilities.},

In Yemen, during 2011-2016, 1811 SARI patients were recorded. Out of the SARI cases 40\% were admitted to ICU with fatality rate 8\%. National Severe Acute Respiratory Illness surveillance system was established 2010 to monitor SARI occurrence in humans and provide a foundation for detecting SARI outbreaks. Objective(s): To assess the performance of the SARI surveillance system, and identify its weakness, and strengthens Methods \& Materials: SARI System was evaluated using Updated CDC guidelines. Related documents and reports were reviewed. Through interviews data were collected from four central-level managers and stakeholders and from ten focal points at four Sentinel sites using semi-structured questionnaire. A scoring system was used based on the following criteria: very poor ({$<$}=20\%), poor ({$>$}20 to {$<$}=40\%), average ({$>$}40 to {$<$}=60\%), good ({$>$}60- {$<$}=80\%) and excellent ({$>$}80\%). Result(s): SARI Surveillance system scored 75\% for usefulness, 86\% for flexibility, 82\% for acceptability and 75\% for stability and simplicity. Regarding data quality, it scored 100\% for completeness and 97\% for accuracy. However, it scored only 59\% for Timeliness and sensitivity and predictive value positive (PVP) could not be calculated due to the unavailability of transport media and laboratory tests. The overall SARI Surveillance system performance was 55\%. Conclusion(s): Although SARI surveillance system found to be useful, simple, flexible, acceptable, stable and data quality was excellent, there was delays in receiving specimens by the laboratory and timely processing of specimens. Therefore, such delays undermine its ability to monitor SARI occurrence and detect early outbreaks. Improving timeliness by providing supplies needed for collecting and transporting samples as well as laboratory reagents for testing is highly recommended.Copyright {\copyright} 2020},

  abstract = {Background               Evaluating public health surveillance systems is important to ensure that events of public health importance are appropriately monitored. Evaluation studies based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines have been used to appraise surveillance systems globally. Previous evaluation studies undertaken in member countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) were limited to specific illnesses within a single nation.                                         Objective               We aimed to evaluate public health surveillance systems in GCC countries using CDC guidelines and recommend necessary improvements to enhance these systems.                                         Methods               The CDC guidelines were used for evaluating the surveillance systems in GCC countries. A total of 6 representatives from GCC countries were asked to rate 43 indicators across the systems' level of usefulness, simplicity, flexibility, acceptability, sensitivity, predictive value positive, representativeness, data quality, stability, and timeliness. Descriptive data analysis and univariate linear regression analysis were performed.                                         Results               All surveillance systems in the GCC covered communicable diseases, and approximately two-thirds (4/6, 67\%, 95\% CI 29.9\%-90.3\%) of them covered health care--associated infections. The mean global score was 147 (SD 13.27). The United Arab Emirates scored the highest in the global score with a rating of 167 (83.5\%, 95\% CI 77.7\%-88.0\%), and Oman obtained the highest scores for usefulness, simplicity, and flexibility. Strong correlations were observed between the global score and the level of usefulness, flexibility, acceptability, representativeness, and timeliness, and a negative correlation was observed between stability and timeliness score. Disease coverage was the most substantial predictor of the GCC surveillance global score.                                         Conclusions               GCC surveillance systems are performing optimally and have shown beneficial outcomes. GCC countries must use the lessons learned from the success of the systems of the United Arab Emirates and Oman. To maintain GCC surveillance systems so that they are viable and adaptable to future potential health risks, measures including centralized information exchange, deployment of emerging technologies, and system architecture reform are necessary.},

A structured questionnaire was developed from the three dimensions of the research (Policy, Structure and Organization). The escore m{\'e}dio (EM) (average score) was used as the central tendency and for each dimension and attributes, the synthetic indices were constructed. Three cutoff points for assessing the performance were assigned: values equal to or below 4.99 were considered unsatisfactory; between 5.00 and 6.99, intermediaries; and equal to or above 7.00, satisfactory. Results: The performance of the regionalization of the VS was considered satisfactory, with emphasis on the 'Policy' (EM 8.51) and 'Organization' (EM 8.18) dimensions. The 'Structure' obtained intermediate performance (EM 6.78). The proposed methodology demonstrated to be appropriate to evaluate the performance of the regionalization of VS, because its strengths and weaknesses were allowed to be identified. Conclusions: Despite of the regionalization is an ongoing process, it is necessary for the establishment of a political project that will take up effectively as a strategy for the reorganization of the healthcare in Brazil.},

Therefore, we evaluated Dangila district's public health surveillance system performance in line with its objectives. Methods: In August 2017, a concurrent embedded mixed quantitative/qualitative, facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Dangila district among 12 health facilities/sites. The qualitative part involved 12 purposively selected key stakeholders interview. A semi-structured questionnaire adapted from updated CDC guideline for evaluating public health surveillance system was used for data collection through face to face interview and record review. The major qualitative findings were narrated and summarized based on thematic areas to supplement the quantitative findings. The quantitative findings were analyzed using Microsoft Excel 2007. Results: All necessary surveillance guidelines, registers and reporting formats were distributed adequately to health facilities. Only the district health office has Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan (EPRP), but not supported by the budget required to respond in case an emergency occurred. There were no regular data analysis and interpretations in terms of time, place and person. Weekly report completeness and timeliness were 100 and 94.6\% respectively. The information collected was considered relevant by its users to detect outbreaks early with high acceptability. All stakeholders agreed that the system is simple, easy to understand, representative and can accommodate modifications. Written feedbacks were not obtained in all health facilities. The supervision checklist obtained in the district was not adequate to assess surveillance activities in detail. The calculated positive predictive value for malaria was 11\%. Conclusions: The surveillance system was simple, useful, flexible, acceptable and representative. Report completeness and timelines were above the national and international targets. However, the overall implementation of the system in the district was not satisfactory to achieve the intended objective of surveillance for public health action due to the lack of regular data analysis and feedback dissemination. To create a well-performing surveillance system, regular supervision and epidemiologically analyzed and interpreted feedback system is mandatory.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: One of the four main elements of the worldwide polio eradication strategy is acute flaccid paralysis surveillance (AFP). This system is based on (acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases reported and tested at World Health Organization (WHO) accredited laboratories. To measure and monitor performance, indicators were created. The current study aims to evaluate the system components, performance, and efficiency in River Nile State, Northern Sudan, and their compliance with World Health Organization (WHO) requirements for it to be adopted as a good system; its results can be used to certify whether a country is polio-free or not., MATERIAL AND METHODS: A facility-based retrospective descriptive study was conducted in the River Nile State, Northern Sudan, from Jan 2017 to Dec 2020. This study included all reporting sites/units, workers who reported acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases, and officers at the locality level. A total of 50 health institutions were visited for surveillance, and interviews with 59 health workers who were part of the AFP surveillance system were undertaken. The data were collected from participants using a pre-tested questionnaire designed and constructed by the World Health Organization (WHO) framework, and the data were analyzed using the SPSS version (22)., RESULTS: The River Nile State's AFP surveillance system was of high quality in terms of the infrastructure that had been put in place and the effectiveness of the system's operations, as evidenced by the following statistics: from 2017 to 2020, the reported non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases were at a mean rate of 4.02 per 100,000 children under the age of 15; the majority of AFP reported cases were under 10 years; and males made up 73.3\% of reported cases; The completeness of reports and surveillance documents exceeded 80\%, and active surveillance was applied in 80\% of reporting sites., CONCLUSION: Despite the fact that the surveillance system is capable of detecting cases, Sudan continues to report cases of imported polio from other countries, highlighting the need to strengthen surveillance systems and eradication efforts in these countries.

  abstract = {PROBLEM/CONDITION: Use of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-mortality surveillance data can help public health officials monitor, evaluate, and improve HIV treatment programs. Many high-income countries have high-coverage civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) systems linked to case-based HIV surveillance on which to base HIV mortality estimates. However, in the absence of comprehensive CRVS systems in low- and medium-income countries, such as Kenya, mortuary surveillance can be used to understand the occurrence of HIV infection among cadavers. In 2015, a pilot HIV-related mortuary surveillance system was implemented in the two largest mortuaries in Nairobi, Kenya. CDC conducted an evaluation to assess performance attributes and identify strengths and weaknesses of the surveillance system pilot., PERIOD COVERED: Data collection: January 29-March 3, 2015; evaluation: November 2015., DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM: The surveillance system objectives were to determine HIV positivity among cadavers at two mortuary sites in Nairobi, Kenya, and to determine annual cause-specific and HIV-specific mortality rates among the cadavers. Cadavers of persons aged {$>$}=15 years at death admitted to either mortuary during a 33-day period were included. Demographic information and place and time of death were entered into a surveillance register. Cardiac blood was collected using transthoracic aspiration, and blood specimens were tested for HIV in a central laboratory. Causes of death were abstracted from mortuary and hospital records. Of the 807 cadavers brought to the mortuaries, 610 (75.6\%) had an HIV test result available. The overall unadjusted HIV-positivity rate was 19.5\% (119/610), which differed significantly by sex (14.6\% among men versus 29.5\% among women)., EVALUATION: The evaluation was conducted using CDC guidelines for evaluating public health surveillance systems. The attributes of simplicity, flexibility, data quality (completeness and validity), acceptability, sensitivity, predictive value positive, representativeness, timeliness, and stability were examined. The evaluation steps included review of the surveillance system documents, in-depth interviews with 20 key informants (surveillance system staff, including mortuary and laboratory staff, and stakeholders involved in funding or implementation), and review of the surveillance database., RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION: Implementation of the pilot mortuary surveillance system was complex because of extensive paperwork and the need to collect and process specimens outside of business hours. However, the flexibility of the system accommodated multiple changes during implementation, including changes in specimen collection techniques and data collection tools. Acceptability was initially low among the mortuary staff but increased after concerns regarding workload were resolved. Timeliness of specimen collection could not be measured because time of death was rarely documented. Completeness of data available from the system was generally high except for cause of death (46.5\%). Although the two largest mortuaries in Nairobi were included, the surveillance system might not be representative of the Nairobi population. One of the mortuaries was affiliated with the national referral hospital and included cadavers of admitted patients, some deaths might have occurred outside Nairobi, and data were collected for only 1 month., PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS: Mortuary surveillance can provide data on HIV positivity among cadavers and HIV-related mortality, which are not available from other sources in most sub-Saharan African countries. Availability of these mortality data will help describe a country's progress toward achieving epidemic control and achieving Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS 95-95-95 targets. To understand HIV mortality in high-prevalence regions, the mortuary surveillance system is being replicated in Western Kenya. Although a low-cost system, its sustainability depends on external funding because mortuary surveillance is not yet incorporated into the national AIDS strategic framework in Kenya.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis remains a public problem that is considered one of the top causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The National Tuberculosis Control Program in Yemen was established in 1970 and included in the national health policy under the leadership of the Ministry of Public Health and Population to monitor tuberculosis control. The surveillance system must be evaluated periodically to produce recommendations for improving performance and usefulness., OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the usefulness and the performance of the tuberculosis surveillance system attributes and to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the system., METHODS: A quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the national tuberculosis surveillance system was conducted using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's updated guidelines. The study was carried out in 10 districts in Sana'a City. A total of 28 public health facilities providing tuberculosis services for the whole population in their assigned catchment areas were purposively selected. All participants were interviewed based on their involvement with key aspects of tuberculosis surveillance activities., RESULTS: The tuberculosis surveillance system was found to have an average performance in usefulness (57/80, 71\%), flexibility (30/40, 75\%), acceptability (174/264, 66\%), data quality (4/6, 67\%), and positive predictive value (78/107, 73\%), and poor performance in simplicity (863/1452, 59\%) and stability (15\%, 3/20). In addition, the system also had a good performance in sensitivity (78/81, 96\%)., CONCLUSIONS: The tuberculosis surveillance system was found to be useful. The flexibility, positive predictive value, and data quality were average. Stability and simplicity were poor. The sensitivity was good. The main weaknesses in the tuberculosis surveillance system include a lack of governmental financial support, a paper-based system, and a lack of regular staff training. Developing an electronic system, securing governmental finances, and training the staff on tuberculosis surveillance are strongly recommended to improve the system performance.

Related documents and reports were reviewed. Data were collected from 4 central-level managers and stakeholders and from 10 focal points at 4 sentinel sites by using a semistructured questionnaire. For each attribute, percent scores were calculated and ranked as follows: very poor ({$<$}=20\%), poor (20\%-40\%), average (40\%-60\%), good (60\%-80\%), and excellent ({$>$}80\%)., RESULTS: As rated by the evaluators, the SARI surveillance system achieved its objectives. The system's flexibility (percent score: 86\%) and acceptability (percent score: 82\%) were rated as "excellent," and simplicity (percent score: 74\%) and stability (percent score: 75\%) were rated as "good." The percent score for timeliness was 23\% in 2018, which indicated poor timeliness. The overall data quality percent score of the SARI system was 98.5\%. Despite its many strengths, the SARI system has some weaknesses. For example, it depends on irregular external financial support., CONCLUSIONS: The SARI surveillance system was useful in estimating morbidity and mortality, monitoring the trends of the disease, and promoting research for informing prevention and control measures. The overall performance of the SARI surveillance system was good. We recommend expanding the system by promoting private health facilities' (eg, private hospitals and private health centers) engagement in SARI surveillance, establishing an electronic database at central and peripheral sites, and providing the National Central Public Health Laboratory with the reagents needed for disease confirmation.

At the national level, AFP surveillance achieved WHO targets throughout the evaluating period for the nonpolio AFP rate of cases per 100,000 members of the population younger than 15 years of age, proportion of AFP cases reported within 7 days, proportion of AFP cases investigated within 48 hours of notification, proportion of AFP cases with two adequate stool specimens, and proportion of stool specimens from which nonpolio enterovirus was isolated. However, the proportion of specimens that arrived at the central level within 3 days of the first sample collection and the proportion of stool specimens with results sent from the reference laboratory within 28 days of receipt did not reach targets in 2011 and 2015, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: The AFP surveillance system in Yemen has met most of the WHO indicator levels. Nevertheless, the evaluation showed areas of weakness regarding the arrival of specimens at the central level within 3 days of the first sample collection and delays in processing of the results and submitting feedback by the laboratory. Therefore, there is a need to strengthen the follow-up of specimens submitted to the laboratory.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Public health surveillance systems should be evaluated periodically, and the evaluation should include recommendations for improving the system's quality and efficiency. Each surveillance system may have a unique situation in which evaluating its quality depends on its methodology, aims, and other factors, such as the frequency of repeating the survey in the case of survey-based surveillance., OBJECTIVE: As the consistency of the surveillance system to capture demographic data and its sensitivity to monitor the intended health-related event are important indicators of the quality of the surveillance system, the aim of this article is to evaluate the Saudi Arabia Mental Health Surveillance System (MHSS) in terms of consistency and sensitivity via the scientific hypothesis testing process., METHODS: The quality of the MHSS was assessed by examining (1) the consistency of the main demographic variables and (2) the sensitivity to changes in score between the 2 mental health screening tools used in the MHSS and between the 3 waves collected in 3 consecutive months. The assessment uses all data collected via the MHSS between May 2020 and July 2020. The first null hypothesis predicted there were differences between the distributions of the demographic variables between the 3 waves. The second predicted there were no differences between the scores of the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7) between the 3 waves., RESULTS: In terms of sampling variables (age, gender, and region), there were no significant differences between the 3 waves in age, using one-way ANOVA, nor in gender and region, using the chi-square test. In addition, there were no significant differences between the 3 waves in all other demographic variables, except in the income variable. However, in terms of the PHQ-9 score, the one-way ANOVA (F2,12334=8.05; P{$<$}.001) showed significant differences between waves. Similarly, significant differences between waves were found in the GAD-7 score (F2,12334=7.09; P=.001)., CONCLUSIONS: The MHSS showed a consistent distribution of the sample demographic variables, while being sensitive to the changes in mental health scores across waves. The MHSS can generate an acceptable level of consistency and sensitivity to monitor mental health trends., INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): RR2-10.2196/23748.

The completeness of the fields present in the research and report forms was assessed by the percentage of filled fields, the Spearman correlation coefficient and graphical analysis., RESULTS: In most of the essential fields it was identified a decrease in the percentage of filling (n = 18; 64\%). The degree of completeness of compulsory fields was high ({$>$} 85\%); most of the non-discriminated fields were 0 - 25\% filled; there were variable indexes for key fields (0 - 98\%). Considerable variability was observed in the completeness of the key fields, having three variables with significant negative correlation (rs = -0.9; p = 0.0347). Only one variable showed significant positive correlation., CONCLUSION: The quality of most of the stored data was classified as regular to excellent for important variables on the design of worker health and surveillance actions.

A rapid increase in population and inadequate sanitary installations increase the risk of diarrheal disease. This study was performed to assess the structure and attributes of the surveillance system in Minawao., METHODS: Updated US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines were used to evaluate the public health surveillance system. Information sources included health registers, surveillance reports, and key informant interviews. Scorecards were used to assess the simplicity, flexibility, data quality, acceptability, sensitivity, timeliness, stability, and usefulness of the system., RESULTS: Surveillance in Minawao is both passive and active, integrating four diseases reported weekly/immediately. All key informants agreed that surveillance was part of their routine work. Of 138 surveillance reports reviewed, all were complete; 91 (66\%) were timely. Overall, 143 (100\%) cases of diarrheal disease identified in health registers were reported to the next level. Only two (20\%) surveillance personnel could correctly state standardized case definitions (SCD); three (30\%) were unable to identify cases of diarrheal disease based on SCD., CONCLUSIONS: In Minawao, diarrheal disease surveillance is acceptable, flexible, sensitive, and useful. To improve timeliness and the use of SCD, we recommend the use of mobile phones to report and display SCD in health facilities. Copyright {\copyright} 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd..

  abstract = {It is necessary to assess surveillance systems for infectious animal diseases to ensure they meet their objectives and provide high-quality health information. Each system is generally dedicated to one disease and often comprises various components. In many animal industries, several surveillance systems are implemented separately even if they are based on similar components. This lack of synergy may prevent optimal surveillance. The purpose of this study was to assess several surveillance systems within the same industry using the semi-quantitative OASIS method and to compare the results of the assessments in order to propose improvements, including future synergies. We have focused on the surveillance of three major equine diseases in France. We have identified the mutual and specific strengths and weaknesses of each surveillance system. Furthermore, the comparative assessment has highlighted many possible synergies that could improve the effectiveness and efficiency of surveillance as a whole, including the implementation of new joint tools or the pooling of existing teams, tools or skills. Our approach is an original application of the OASIS method, which requires minimal financial resources and is not very time-consuming. Such a comparative evaluation could conceivably be applied to other surveillance systems, other industries and other countries. This approach would be especially relevant to enhance the efficiency of surveillance activities when resources are limited.Copyright {\copyright} Cambridge University Press 2015.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Malaria is a priority global health disease with high morbidity and mortality especially among children under-five and pregnant women. Malaria elimination requires an effective surveillance system. The malaria surveillance system in Benue State was evaluated to assess its attributes and performance in line with set objectives., METHODS: The updated United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guideline for evaluating surveillance systems was used. The surveillance system's key attributes was quantitatively and qualitatively assessed. Semi-structured questionnaires were administered to all Local Government Area (LGA) Roll Back Malaria (RBM) focal persons and five key informants were interviewed at the State level. The Benue State District Health Information System-2 (DHIS-2) malaria data and monthly summary forms were reviewed from January 2015 to December 2019., RESULTS: A total of 46 RBM focal persons and 5 key-informants participated. About 56.9\% were males, the mean-age 43.8 (SD +/- 9.3) years and 32 (62.8\%) had {$>$}= 20-year experience on malaria surveillance with mean-year-experience 20.8 (SD +/- 7.8) years. All 46 (100\%) RBMs understood the case definition; 43 (93.5\%) found it easy-to-fill the standardized data tools and understood the data flow channels. The malaria surveillance system in Benue is simple, acceptable and useful to all stakeholders, 36 (70.6\%) found switching from the paper-based to the electronic-data tools with ease and 45 (88.2\%) stated that analysed data were used for decision-making. Data flow from LGA to State is clearly defined, however majority of the data is collected from public health facilities through the DHIS-2 Platform. The overall timeliness and completeness of reporting was 76.5\% and 95.7\%, respectively, which were below the {$>$}= 80\% and 100\% targets, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: The malaria surveillance system in Benue State is simple, useful, acceptable, and flexible, but it is not representative and timely. Public-private and public-public-partnerships should be strengthened to encourage reporting from both private and tertiary health facilities and improve representativeness, and frequent feedback to improve reporting timeliness.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the case-based measles surveillance system in Kaduna State of Nigeria and identify gaps in its operation., INTRODUCTION: In Africa, approximately 13 million cases, 650,000 deaths due to measles occur annually, with sub-Saharan Africa having the highest morbidity and mortality. Measles infection is endemic in Nigeria and has been documented to occur all year round, despite high measles routine and supplemental immunization coverage. The frequent outbreaks of measles in Kaduna State prompted the need for the evaluation of the measles case-based surveillance system., METHODS: We interviewed stakeholders and conducted a retrospective record review of the measles case-based surveillance data from 2010 - 2012 and adapted the 2001 CDC guidelines on surveillance evaluation and the Framework for Evaluating Public Health Surveillance Systems for Early Detection of Outbreaks, to assess the systems usefulness, representativeness, timeliness, stability, acceptability and data quality. We calculated the annualized detection rate of measles and non-measles febrile rash, proportion of available results, proportion of LGAs (Districts) that investigated at least one case with blood, proportion of cases that were IgM positive and the incidence of measles. We compared the results with WHO(2004) recommended performance indicators to determine the quality and effectiveness of measles surveillance system., RESULTS: According to the Stakeholders, the case-based surveillance system was useful and acceptable. Median interval between specimen collection and release of result was 7days (1 - 25 days) in 2010, 38 days (Range: 16 - 109 days) in 2011 and 11 days (Range: 1 - 105 days) in 2012. The annualized detection rate of measles rash in 2010 was 2.1 (target: 32), 1.0 (target: 32) in 2011 and 1.4 (target: 32) in 2012. The annualized detection rate of non-measles febrile rash in 2010 was 2.1 (target: 32), 0.6 (target: 32) in 2011 and 0.8 (target: 32) in 2012. Case definitions are simple and understood by all the operators., CONCLUSION: This evaluation showed that the surveillance system was still useful. Also, the efficiency and effectiveness of the laboratory component as captured by the "median interval between specimen collection and the release of results improved in 2010 and 2012 compared to 2011. However, there was a progressive decline in the timeliness and completeness of weekly reports in the years under review.},

Currently, the National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) uses two malaria surveillance systems: the Integrated Malaria Surveillance System (IMSS) and the Early Disease Electronic Warning System (eDEWS). This study aimed to assess and compare the usefulness and attributes of the two malaria surveillance systems. The systems were evaluated according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated guidelines. Data were collected from 10 stakeholders through interviews and from 10 districts' coordinators and 20 health facilities' focal points using semistructured questionnaire. The score of the system attributes were interpreted as very poor, poor, average, good, and excellent according to the mean percent score. Both systems were found to be useful. The IMSS overall performance score was poor where flexibility was average and simplicity, acceptability, representativeness, and stability were poor. For eDEWS, the overall performance score was good where data quality, acceptability, and flexibility were excellent; simplicity was good; representativeness was average; and stability was poor. In conclusion, although the IMSS was found to be useful for assessing the burden of malaria, response to outbreak, and future planning, the overall performance was poor. While the eDEWS overall level of performance was good, it was found to be useful only for outbreak detection. Therefore, both surveillance systems need to be integrated for the advantages of both systems to be maintained.},

In this study, we evaluated the completeness, timeliness and sensitivity of the IMD surveillance in Italy from 2015 to 2018. Completeness and timeliness were described at the national and subnational level. A capture-recapture analysis was conducted to evaluate the sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) using HDR as the external source with a combination of deterministic and probabilistic approaches. The characteristics of the unmatched vs. matched cases were compared using multivariable Poisson modeling. Overall, the completeness of data improved, except for specific variables. Timeliness of notifications also improved to a median of 4 days from onset to reporting. For the years 2015-2017, the sensitivity of the surveillance was estimated at 71.4\% and the PPV at 77.5\%, changing to 80.6\% and 66.9\% respectively after removing cases with a secondary meningitis diagnosis. We noted substantial sub-national differences. In 2018 sensitivity was 66.5\% (135/203) and the PPV was 79.4\% (135/170). The adjusted relative risk of being unmatched in 2015-2017 was higher in cases that were {$>$}=60 years, had missing information or symptom onset in December. The IMD surveillance system overall performs well with completeness and timeliness improving in time. Specific challenges identified for individual variables should guide further improvement. Notwithstanding limitations posed by the comparison database, sensitivity and PPV are promising. The study highlights that promoting etiological ascertainment in people {$>$}=60 years and addressing sub-national challenges are the main current challenges to address.},

In response, we describe PCC indicators and the evaluation process used to identify a set of PCC indicators for state use. Materials and Methods: The Surveillance and Research Workgroup and Clinical Workgroup of the National Preconception Health and Health Care Initiative used a systematic process to identify, evaluate, and prioritize PCC indicators from nationwide public health surveillance systems that Maternal and Child Health (MCH) programs can use for state-level surveillance using the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). For each indicator, we assessed target population, prevalence, measurement simplicity, data availability, clinical utility, and whether it was related to the 10 prioritized preconception health indicators. We also assessed relevance to clinical recommendations, Healthy People (HP)2020 objectives, and the National Quality Forum measures. Lastly, we considered input from stakeholders and subject matter experts. Results: Eighty potential PCC indicators were initially identified. After conducting evaluations, obtaining stakeholder input, and consulting with subject matter experts, the list was narrowed to 30 PCC indicators for states to consider using in their MCH programs to inform the need for new strategies and monitor programmatic activities. PRAMS is the data source for 27 of the indicators, and BRFSS is the data source for three indicators. Conclusions: The identification and evaluation of population-based PCC indicators that are available at the state level increase opportunities for state MCH programs to document, monitor, and address PCC in their locales.},

  abstract = {Background: HIV surveillance is essential to quantifying the impact of the epidemic and shaping HIV programs. The Maryland Department of Health (MDH) historically conducted HIV Data to Care (D2C) activities using surveillance data to identify individuals who were not in HIV care; however, most case investigations concluded that the individuals in question were currently engaged in care. This suggests that delays and gaps in laboratory reporting to HIV surveillance exist and the proportion of HIV-positive Marylanders who are truly in care is underestimated. Therefore, solely relying on surveillance data might not be an efficient method for identifying not in care HIV cases. Setting: Through the Partnerships for Care (P4C) project, MDH conducted targeted D2C efforts on HIV patients from 4 health centers. Methods: The expanded D2C model that MDH created during P4C integrated clinical data as a secondary data source to enhance the surveillance data used to estimate HIV patient care engagement. MDH matched and compared health center electronic health records with HIV surveillance data to assess completeness of HIV case and laboratory reporting. Results: HIV case ascertainment was high (99.9\%) for the P4C cohort (N=927), but differences in estimated care engagement and viral suppression between data sources revealed incomplete laboratory reporting and that patients received care from multiple providers. Analyzing the clinical data leads to the resolution of several reporting gaps, which improved surveillance data quality over time. Conclusions: Health departments should validate their HIV surveillance completeness. Triangulating surveillance data with clinical data generated more accurate depictions of care engagement and increased D2C efficiency.},

  abstract = {In the context of Epidemic Intelligence, many Event-Based Surveillance (EBS) systems have been proposed in the literature to promote the early identification and characterization of potential health threats from online sources of any nature. Each EBS system has its own surveillance definitions and priorities, therefore this makes the task of selecting the most appropriate EBS system for a given situation a challenge for end-users. In this work, we propose a new evaluation framework to address this issue. It first transforms the raw input epidemiological event data into a set of normalized events with multi-granularity, then conducts a descriptive retrospective analysis based on four evaluation objectives: spatial, temporal, thematic and source analysis. We illustrate its relevance by applying it to an Avian Influenza dataset collected by a selection of EBS systems, and show how our framework allows identifying their strengths and drawbacks in terms of epidemic surveillance. {\copyright} 2013 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Background: Civil wars in the Great Lakes region resulted in massive displacement of people to neighboring countries including Uganda. With associated disease epidemics related to this conflict, a disease surveillance system was established aiming for timely detection of diseases and rapid response to outbreaks. We describe the evaluation of and lessons learned from the public health surveillance system set up in refugee settlements in Uganda. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey using the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Updated Guidelines for Evaluating Public Health Surveillance Systems and the Uganda National Technical Guidelines for Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response in four refugee settlements in Uganda-Bidibidi, Adjumani, Kiryandongo and Rhino Camp. Using semi-structured questionnaires, key informant and focus group discussion guides, we interviewed 53 health facility leaders, 12 key personnel and 224 village health team members from 53 health facilities and 112 villages and assessed key surveillance functions and attributes. Results: All health facilities assessed had key surveillance staff; 60\% were trained on Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response and most village health teams were trained on disease surveillance. Case detection was at 55\%; facilities lacked standard case definitions and were using parallel Implementing Partner driven reporting systems. Recording was at 79\% and reporting was at 81\%. Data analysis and interpretation was at 49\%. Confirmation of outbreaks and events was at 76\%. Preparedness was at 72\%. Response was at 34\%. Feedback was at 82\%. Evaluate and improve the system was at 67\%. There was low capacity for detection, response and data analysis and interpretation of cases ({$<$} 60\%). Conclusion: The surveillance system in the refugee settlements was functional with many performing attributes but with many remaining gaps. There was low capacity for detection, response and data analysis and interpretation in all the refugee settlements. There is need for improvement to align surveillance systems in refugee settlements with the mainstream surveillance system in the country. Implementing Partners should be urged to offer support for surveillance and training of surveillance staff on Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response to maintain effective surveillance functions. Functionalization of district teams ensures achievement of surveillance functions and attributes. Regular supervision of and support to health facility surveillance personnel is essential. Harmonization of reporting improves surveillance functions and attributes and appropriation of funds by government to districts to},

With the aim of promoting its notification in Navarre, the Sentinel Program was incorporated in 2013 and, with this study, we seek to verify its efficacy., METHODS: The study population were voice professionals reported for dysphonia as sentinel events during the years 2013 to 2015 in Navarre. Its effectiveness was validated by the cumulative incidence of 100,000 workers for each of the years and Positive Predictive Value as an indicator of suspicion. The declaration was verified as an occupational disease., RESULTS: In the period April 2013 to December, 110 cases were reported, 71 nominal and 39 non-nominal. The annual incidence increased from 9.0 cases per 100,000 to 13.4. Of the cases investigated, 63 were women and 8 men. The mean age was 40.8 years (38.5-43.1 95\% CI). 58 cases (81.7\%) corresponded to teachers. In 22 of the 71 nodules (31\%) and 9 coincidences were notified as an occupational disease. We found a greater presence of nodules in professionals with extra work use of voice (OR 4.2 IC 1.3-14.3) and better evolution of pathologies other than VN (OR = 2.5 CI 1.1-5.8 ). The suspicion was confirmed as occupational in 54 cases (positive predictive value 76.1\%)., CONCLUSIONS: The centinel program is effective in reporting dysphonia although it is important to highlight the low declaration as occupational disease of the cases detected.},

  abstract = {Background: In Ghana, 77\% of traceable foodborne diseases results from improper handling in Food Service Establishments (FSE). The FSE Inspection surveillance system instituted by the Food and Drugs Authority (FDA) in 2010 inspects and license FSEs to ensure compliance to Good Hygienic Practices (GHP). We evaluated the FSE Inspection surveillance system to assess if the systems objectives were being met and to assess attributes and usefulness of the system. Method: We evaluated the FSE surveillance system by interviewing 20 stakeholders in the Greater Accra Region (GAR) using a semi-structured questionnaire adapted from the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention updated guidelines for evaluating health surveillance systems. We reviewed systems records from 2017 to 2019 and made observations of surveillance activities. Microsoft excel was used for collation and analysis of data into frequencies and proportions and results were presented in tables and graphs. Result: From 2017 to 2019, 36.5\% (876/2400) FSE applications were received with 1206 inspections carried out within the evaluation period. About 14.8\% (355/2400) FSE's accepted the system with 12 out of 16 Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies (MMDA's) represented in the surveillance system. Overall, sensitivity was at 60.5\% with (530/876) of FSEs issued with a food hygiene permit (FHP). System restructuring or modifications barely affected the operational procedures. Timeliness was 54.3\% (38/70) with almost half of FSEs inspected after the 40 days benchmark. Data completeness was 93.8\% (333/355) for stored data. Conclusion: The FSE inspection surveillance system was found to be useful in meeting its set objective of ensuring FSE compliance to GHP. The system was flexible, stable and sensitive but was not acceptable, fairly timely and had a poor representation in GAR. Introduction of an electronic application or web-based inspections and strengthening of collaboration among stakeholders are key to improving the systems timeliness and representativeness respectively.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ebola virus disease (EVD) can be clinically severe and highly fatal, making surveillance efforts for early disease detection of paramount importance. In areas with limited access to laboratory testing, the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) may be a vital tool in improving outbreak response., METHODS: Using DRC IDSR data from the nation's four EVD outbreak periods from 2007-2014, we assessed trends of Viral Hemorrhagic Fever (VHF) and EVD differential diagnoses reportable through IDSR. With official case counts from active surveillance of EVD outbreaks, we assessed accuracy of reporting through the IDSR passive surveillance system., RESULTS: Although the active and passive surveillance represent distinct sets of data, the two were correlated, suggesting that passive surveillance based only on clinical evaluation may be a useful predictor of true cases prior to laboratory confirmation. There were 438 suspect VHF cases reported through the IDSR system and 416 EVD cases officially recorded across the outbreaks examined., CONCLUSION: Although collected prior to official active surveillance cases, case reporting through the IDSR during the 2007, 2008 and 2012 outbreaks coincided with official EVD epidemic curves. Additionally, all outbreak areas experienced increases in suspected cases for both malaria and typhoid fever during EVD outbreaks, underscoring the importance of training health care workers in recognising EVD differential diagnoses and the potential for co-morbidities.

  abstract = {Background: Public health surveillance is done to assess the health status of a population, establish public health priorities, and reduce the burden of disease in a population. In Uganda, notifiable diseases including hemorrhagic fevers are a constant threat to the health of both animals and humans. Rabies and Ebola were confirmed in central Uganda in 2012 where animals are reservoirs for the diseases. However the veterinary disease surveillance system has long not been evaluated for its effectiveness in early disease detection. The study evaluated the effectiveness of the Veterinary disease surveillance system in Mubende District, central Uganda. Method(s): We reviewed and abstracted secondary data from monthly reports of 15 reporting subcounties of the District 2007 to 2011. Key informants were interviewed using an interview guide. We assessed the District surveillance system attributes using CDC guidelines. Data was entered and analyzed using Epi- info version 3.5.1 Results: Only 34 \% of the total monthly reports were received at District in 2007, 70\% in 2008, 43\% in 2009, 11\% in 2010 and 4\% in 2011. Of the expected field reports 38\% were received before 7th and 97\% before 15th of the next month at the District. (Ministry expects reports by 15th). Standard data collection tools not used by all staff, structure hard in data flow, understaffing (16\%), no zero reporting, no laboratory at district; use of visual surveillance by staff and data kept in hard, inconsistency in reporting and bulky surveillance tool. On average, 32\% of the expected reports were received at District in five years. The system was able to capture three outbreaks but unable to confirm any diseases including Rabies and Trypanosomiasis. Key informants showed that low performance was due to no incentives to staff and ministry restructure. Conclusion(s): The veterinary disease surveillance system for Mubende District is not optimal. The ministries of health and veterinary should recruit staff and sensitise on disease surveillance and use of standard surveillance tools. Provide basic laboratory facilities to screen and confirm diseases.

  abstract = {Background: Over the past three decades, the capacity to develop and implement injury surveillance systems (ISS) has grown worldwide and is reflected by the diversity of data gathering environments in which ISS operate. The capacity to evaluate ISS, however, is less advanced and existing evaluation guidelines are ambiguous. Furthermore, the applied relevance of these guidelines to evaluate ISS operating in various settings is unclear. The aim of this paper was to examine how the World Health Organization (WHO) injury surveillance guidelines have been applied to evaluate systems operating in three different contexts. Methods: The attributes of a good surveillance system as well as instructions for conducting evaluations, outlined in the WHO injury surveillance guidelines, were used to develop an analytical framework. Using this framework, a comparative analysis of the application of the guidelines was conducted using; the Aboriginal CommunityCentered Injury Surveillance System (ACCISS) from Canada, the Shantou-Emergency Department Injury Surveillance Project (S-EDISP) from China, and the Yorkhill-Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (Y-CHIRPP) imported from Canada and implemented in Scotland. Results: The WHO guidelines provide only a basic platform for evaluation. The guidelines over emphasize epidemiologic attributes and methods and under emphasize public health and injury prevention perspectives requiring adaptation for context-based relevance. Evaluation elements related to the dissemination and use of knowledge, acceptability, and the sustainability of ISS are notably inadequate. From a public health perspective, alternative reference points are required for re-conceptualizing evaluation paradigms. This paper offers an ISS evaluation template that considers how the WHO guidelines could be adapted and applied. Conclusions: Findings suggest that attributes of a good surveillance system, when used as evaluation metrics, cannot be weighted equally across ISS. In addition, the attribute of acceptability likely holds more relevance than previously recognized and should be viewed as a critical underpinning attribute of ISS. Context-oriented evaluations sensitive to distinct operational environments are more likely to address knowledge gaps related to; understanding links between the production of injury data and its use, and the effectiveness, impact, and sustainability of ISS. Current frameworks are predisposed to disassociating epidemiologic approaches from subjective factors and social processes.},

We therefore aimed to examine the operations of the COVID-19 surveillance system in New Juaben South Municipality, describe its attributes and explore whether its objectives were being met. Methods: we utilized a mixed method descriptive study design to evaluate the COVID-19 surveillance system in the New Juaben South Municipality of the Eastern Region of Ghana. Desk review and key informant interviews were carried out from 1st February to 31st March 2021 to measure nine surveillance system attributes as an approximation of its performance using the CDC's 2013 updated surveillance system guidelines. Results: while the COVID-19 surveillance system in New Juaben South (NJS) was highly representative of its population, it was rated `moderate' for its stability, flexibility, sensitivity and acceptability. The system was however characterized by a low performance on data quality, simplicity, timeliness and predictive value positive. The sensitivity and predictive value positive (PVP) of the system were 55.6\% and 31.3\% respectfully. Conclusion: while the surveillance system is only partially meeting its objectives, it is useful in the COVID-19 response in New Juaben South Municipality. System performance could improve with stigma reduction especially among health care workers, timely testing and simplification of surveillance forms and software.},

  abstract = {In 2015, more than 27 million people in the United States reported that they currently used illicit drugs or misused prescription drugs, and more than 66 million reported binge drinking during the previous month. Data from public health surveillance systems on drug and alcohol abuse are crucial for developing and evaluating interventions to prevent and control such behavior. However, public health surveillance for behavioral health in the United States has been hindered by organizational issues and other factors. For example, existing guidelines for surveillance evaluation do not distinguish between data systems that characterize behavioral health problems and those that assess other public health problems (eg, infectious diseases). To address this gap in behavioral health surveillance, we present a revised framework for evaluating behavioral health surveillance systems. This system framework builds on published frameworks and incorporates additional attributes (informatics capabilities and population coverage) that we deemed necessary for evaluating behavioral health-related surveillance. This revised surveillance evaluation framework can support ongoing improvements to behavioral health surveillance systems and ensure their continued usefulness for detecting, preventing, and managing behavioral health problems.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Following the twin earthquakes on August 11, 2012, in the East Azerbaijan province of Iran, the provincial health center set up a surveillance system to monitor communicable diseases. This study aimed to assess the performance of this surveillance system., METHODS: In this quantitative-qualitative study, performance of the communicable diseases surveillance system was assessed by using the updated guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Qualitative data were collected through interviews with the surveillance system participants, and quantitative data were obtained from the surveillance system., RESULTS: The surveillance system was useful, simple, representative, timely, and flexible. The data quality, acceptability, and stability of the surveillance system were 65.6\%, 10.63\%, and 100\%, respectively. The sensitivity and positive predictive value were not calculated owing to the absence of a gold standard., CONCLUSIONS: The surveillance system satisfactorily met the goals expected for its setup. The data obtained led to the control of communicable diseases in the affected areas. Required interventions based on the incidence of communicable disease were designed and implemented. The results also reassured health authorities and the public. However, data quality and acceptability should be taken into consideration and reviewed for implementation in future disasters.}

  abstract = {Objective: One of the most important measures following disasters is setting up a communicable disease surveillance system (CDSS). This study aimed to develop indicators to assess the performance of CDSSs in disasters. Method: In this 3-phase study, firstly a qualitative study was conducted through in-depth, semistructured interviews with experts on health in disasters and emergencies, health services managers, and communicable diseases center specialists. The interviews were analyzed, and CDSS performance assessment (PA) indicators were extracted. The appropriateness of these indicators was examined through a questionnaire administered to experts and heads of communicable diseases departments of medical sciences universities. Finally, the designed indicators were weighted using the analytic hierarchy process approach and Expert Choice software. Results: In this study, 51 indicators were designed, of which 10 were related to the input (19.61\%), 17 to the process (33.33\%), 13 to the product (25.49\%), and 11 to the outcome (21.57\%). In weighting, the maximum score was that of input (49.1), and the scores of the process, product, and outcome were 31.4, 12.7, and 6.8, respectively. Conclusion: Through 3 different phases, PA indicators for 4 phases of a chain of results were developed. The authors believe that these PA indicators can assess the system's performance and its achievements in response to disasters.},

All retrieved titles were examined in accordance with inclusion criteria. Abstracts of the relevant titles were reviewed and eligible abstracts were included in a list for data abstraction. Finally, the study variables were extracted., RESULTS: Sixteen articles and one book were found relevant to our study objectives. In these articles, 31 criteria and 35 indicators were used or suggested for the assessment/evaluation of the performance of surveillance systems in disasters. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) updated guidelines for the evaluation of public health surveillance systems were the most widely used., CONCLUSION: Despite the importance of performance assessment in improving CDS in response to disasters, there is a lack of clear and accepted frameworks. There is also no agreement on the use of existing criteria and indices. The only relevant framework is the CDC guideline, which is a common framework for assessing public health surveillance systems as a whole. There is an urgent need to develop appropriate frameworks, criteria, and indices for specifically assessing the performance of CDS in response to disasters and other emergencies, including infectious diseases outbreaks.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization recommends periodic evaluations of influenza surveillance systems to identify areas for improvement and provide evidence of data reliability for policymaking. However, data about the performance of established influenza surveillance systems are limited in Africa, including in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)., METHODS: We used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines to evaluate the performance of the influenza sentinel surveillance system (ISSS) in DRC during 2012-2015. The performance of the system was evaluated using eight surveillance attributes: (i) data quality and completeness for key variables, (ii) timeliness, (iii) representativeness, (iv) flexibility, (v) simplicity, (vi) acceptability, (vii) stability and (viii) utility. For each attribute, specific indicators were developed and described using quantitative and qualitative methods. Scores for each indicator were as follows: {$<$} 60\% weak performance; 60-79\% moderate performance; {$>$}=80\% good performance., RESULTS: During 2012-2015, we enrolled and tested 4339 patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) and 2869 patients with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) from 11 sentinel sites situated in 5 of 11 provinces. Influenza viruses were detected in 446 (10.3\%) samples from patients with ILI and in 151 (5.5\%) samples from patients with SARI with higher detection during December-May. Data quality and completeness was {$>$} 90\% for all evaluated indicators. Other strengths of the system were timeliness, simplicity, stability and utility that scored {$>$} 70\% each. Representativeness, flexibility and acceptability had moderate performance. It was reported that the ISSS contributed to: (i) a better understanding of the epidemiology, circulating patterns and proportional contribution of influenza virus among patients with ILI or SARI; (ii) acquisition of new key competences related to influenza surveillance and diagnosis; and (iii) continuous education of surveillance staff and clinicians at sentinel sites about influenza. However, due to limited resources no actions were undertaken to mitigate the impact of seasonal influenza epidemics., CONCLUSIONS: The system performed overall satisfactorily and provided reliable and timely data about influenza circulation in DRC. The simplicity of the system contributed to its stability. A better use of the available data could be made to inform and promote prevention interventions especially among the most vulnerable groups.},

From 2009, the Swiss established a Campylobacter mitigation system that includes human and poultry surveillance data-sharing within a multi-sectorial platform, in a 'One Health' approach. The objective of this study was to explore the economics of this cross-sectorial approach, including surveillance and triggered interventions. Costs and benefits of the One Health and of the uni-sectorial approach to Campylobacter surveillance were identified using an economic assessment framework developed earlier. Cost information of surveillance activities and interventions was gathered and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) associated with the disease estimated for 2008 and 2013. In the first 5 years of this One Health approach to Campylobacter mitigation, surveillance contributed with information mainly used to perform risk assessments, monitor trends and shape research efforts on Campylobacter. There was an increase in costs associated with the mitigation activities following integration, due mainly to the allocation of additional resources to research and implementation of poultry surveillance. The overall burden of campylobacteriosis increased by 3.4-8.8\% to 1751-2852 DALYs in 2013. In the timing of the analysis, added value associated with this cross-sectorial approach to surveillance of Campylobacter in the country was likely generated through non-measurable benefits such as intellectual capital and social capital.},

This includes surveillance systems for zoonoses, where enhanced cross-sectoral integration and sharing of information are seen as key to improved public health outcomes. Yet, there is a lack of evidence on the economic returns of such collaboration, particularly in the development and implementation of surveillance programmes. The economic assessment of surveillance in this context needs to be underpinned by the understanding of the links between zoonotic disease surveillance in animal populations and the wider public health disease mitigation process and how these relations impact on the costs and benefits of the surveillance activities. This study presents a conceptual framework of these links as a basis for the economic assessment of cross-sectoral zoonoses surveillance with the aim of supporting the prioritization of resource allocation to surveillance. In the proposed framework, monetary, non-monetary and intermediate or intangible cost components and benefit streams of three conceptually distinct stages of zoonotic disease mitigation are identified. In each stage, as the final disease mitigation objective varies so does the use of surveillance information generated in the animal populations for public health decision-making. Consequently, the associated cost components and benefit streams also change. Building on the proposed framework and taking into account these links, practical steps for its application are presented and future challenges are discussed.},

  abstract = {Background: An estimated 920,136 children died worldwide from pneumonia in 2015. In Ghana, about 4000 children die each year from pneumonia, which makes it the 5th leading cause of death. The Northern Region tops under five mortality rate in Ghana, and pneumonia is the third leading causes of deaths in Northern Region. The pneumonia under-five surveillance system has not been evaluated since its inception in 2012 in the Northern region of Ghana. We evaluated the pneumonia under-five surveillance system in Savelugu-Nanton Municipality, to examine whether the system was meeting its objectives. Methods and materials: We conducted this evaluation in Savelugu-Nanton Municipality from January to February, 2019. Systems' performance, usefulness and attributes were assessed using CDC updated guidelines (2001). Surveillance data in the district health information management system (DHIMS 2) at the municipality from 2015-2018 were extracted and analyzed descriptively using frequencies and proportions, and presented in tables and figures. We interviewed stakeholders using semi-structured questionnaire. Records were also reviewed at some health facilities, sub-municipal and at municipal levels. Result(s): A total of 3351 cases were detected and reported over four year period but cases were not classified (as severe and non-severe), and alert epidemic threshold does not exist. Males (54.2\%) and age bracket 1-4 years (56.1\%) were mostly affected. Pneumonia under-five peaked in 2016 (3073.3 per 100,000) and average rate of 2575.1 per 100,000. The system was easy to operate since it was integrated with other diseases and does not require filling case based form. The system was operating at all levels but data disparity existed between DHIMS 2 and some reporting units. Predicted value positive was not estimated since laboratory and/or X-ray confirmation were lacking. Conclusion(s): The pneumonia under-five surveillance system is useful and partly achieving its objectives. The system was simple, sensitive, stable, acceptable, flexible and representative. Data quality was good. We recommend that laboratory component should be strengthened and to provide additional columns on the Intergrated Disease Surveillance System and Response (IDSR) reporting forms and in DHIMS 2 for reporting severe and non-severe cases.Copyright {\copyright} 2020},

This study aims to describe the characteristics of the system and its usefulness for decision makers., METHODS: Anonymized data from the administrative part of death certificates were daily collected from 3062 computerized city halls and were transmitted to Sante publique France in routine. Coverage of the system was measured as the proportion of deaths registered by the system among the complete number of deaths and analyzed by age, month and region. Deaths were described by gender, age and geographical level using proportion. The excess periods of deaths were described based on the comparison of the weekly observed and expected numbers of deaths between 2012 and 2016., RESULTS: The system recorded 77.5\% of the national mortality covering the whole territory. About 81\% of deaths were aged 65 years old and more. The surveillance system identified mortality variations mainly during winter and summer, for some concomitant with influenza epidemic or heatwave period, and thus provided information for decision makers., CONCLUSION: The ability of the system to detect and follow mortality outbreaks in routine in the whole territory has been demonstrated. It is a useful tool to provide early evaluation of the impact of threats on mortality and alert decision makers to adapt control measures. However, the absence of information on medical causes of death may limit the ability to target recommendations. Copyright {\copyright} The Author(s) 2018.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mortality surveillance is of fundamental importance to public health surveillance. The real-time recording of death certificates, thanks to Electronic Death Registration System (EDRS), provides valuable data for reactive mortality surveillance based on medical causes of death in free-text format. Reactive mortality surveillance is based on the monitoring of mortality syndromic groups (MSGs). An MSG is a cluster of medical causes of death (pathologies, syndromes or symptoms) that meets the objectives of early detection and impact assessment of public health events. The aim of this study is to implement and measure the performance of a rule-based method and two supervised models for automatic free-text cause of death classification from death certificates in order to implement them for routine surveillance., METHOD: A rule-based method was implemented using four processing steps: standardization rules, splitting causes of death using delimiters, spelling corrections and dictionary projection. A supervised machine learning method using a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier was also implemented. Two models were produced using different features (SVM1 based solely on surface features and SVM2 combining surface features and MSGs classified by the rule-based method as feature vectors). The evaluation was conducted using an annotated subset of electronic death certificates received between 2012 and 2016. Classification performance was evaluated on seven MSGs (Influenza, Low respiratory diseases, Asphyxia/abnormal respiration, Acute respiratory disease, Sepsis, Chronic digestive diseases, and Chronic endocrine diseases)., RESULTS: The rule-based method and the SVM2 model displayed a high performance with F-measures over 0.94 for all MSGs. Precision and recall were slightly higher for the rule-based method and the SVM2 model. An error-analysis shows that errors were not specific to an MSG., CONCLUSION: The high performance of the rule-based method and SVM2 model will allow us to set-up a reactive mortality surveillance system based on free-text death certificates. This surveillance will be an added-value for public health decision making. Copyright {\copyright} 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This surveillance system like other health programs needs to be evaluated. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate CMSS in Iran., METHODS: This evaluation was performed from March 2015 to March 2016 based on selected criteria for assessing the public health surveillance system proposed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Selected criteria examined in this study included timeliness, simplicity, acceptability, and flexibility. These criteria were evaluated in two ways. First, it included the use of a researcher-made questionnaire. The questionnaires were completed by 100 experts on CMSS. Second, to perform a more exact evaluation of these criteria, 24 of these experts were selected for the focus group., RESULTS: In this study, the response rate was 91\% (42\% hospital-based and 49\% primary care-based). In the timeliness section, 49\% of the experts believed that approvals of the child mortality committees have not been sent within the designated time frame; hardware, software, and questionnaires were reported as effective factors in this respect. The structural and administrative problems were effective in simplicity domain and the experts of mortality registration and mood of relatives were effective in acceptability domain. The flexibility of the system was high and appropriate., CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study reveal that CMSS has some limitations and problems in the timeliness, simplicity, and acceptability criteria, which can be resolved. But this program has an appropriate situation in terms of flexibility. Copyright: {\copyright} 2019 International Journal of Preventive Medicine.},

This article assesses the surveillance system in IHR 2005 by applying well-established frameworks for evaluating public health surveillance. The assessment shows that IHR 2005 constitutes a major advance in global surveillance from what has prevailed in the past. Effectively implementing the IHR 2005 surveillance objectives requires surmounting technical, resource, governance, legal, and political obstacles. Although IHR 2005 contains some provisions that directly address these obstacles, active support by the World Health Organization and its member states is required to strengthen national and global surveillance capabilities.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: As South Africa strives to achieve malaria elimination by 2018 (zero local cases) the country needs to strengthen its disease surveillance system by reducing the timeliness from case diagnosis to notification of key stakeholders in the malaria programme. This study evaluated the feasibility of a 24-h mobile reporting system, designed for speeding up malaria notifications, from primary healthcare facilities to district, provincial, and national malaria programmes in South Africa., METHODS: A prospective descriptive study utilizing primary data collected from structured interviews with healthcare workers in public healthcare facilities was used to compare two reporting systems (24-h mobile reporting system and the paper-based reporting system) in malaria endemic provinces (Limpopo, Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal). Data on completeness of reporting, simplicity, user acceptability and technical limitations were analysed. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare the time difference between the two reporting systems., RESULTS: There were 1819 cases of malaria reported through the paper-based system, and 63.2\% (1149) of those cases were also reported through the 24-h mobile reporting system. Out of the 272 healthcare workers who were interviewed, 40\% (108) had seen malaria patients and reported a case through the 24-h mobile reporting system. The median time for cases to be reported through the 24-h mobile reporting system was significantly shorter at {$<$} 1 day (range {$<$} 1 to 31 days) compared to the paper-based system at 3 days (range 2 to {$>$} 39 days) (p {$<$} 0.001). It was found that 26\% (28) were able to use the system and send reports within 2 min, 94\% (256) were willing to continue to use the system. Of the 108 healthcare workers who reported a case, 18.5\% (20) experienced network challenges., CONCLUSIONS: The 24-h mobile reporting system is user friendly and trained healthcare workers are willing to use the system, despite network limitations. The 24-h mobile reporting system reduces the time required for diagnosed cases to be notified by the health care facility to district, provincial and national levels. The 24-h mobile reporting system is a feasible option for malaria notification in South Africa and will assist with early detection of malaria outbreaks.},

We evaluate electronic national health information system (SIS-MA) performance to verify if the data flow procedures met its objectives and evaluated the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) surveillance system to access its attributes and usefulness., METHODS: we conducted a descriptive, cross-sectional evaluation of the PMTCT surveillance system in eight facilities in Gaza and Inhambane provinces using the centers for disease control and prevention guidelines (2001). For data quality, we cross-referenced patient registries from health facilities against the SIS-MA. We also interviewed 34 health technicians, using a Likert scale, to assess the following attributes of the PMTCT surveillance system: simplicity, stability, flexibility, acceptability, timeliness and data quality, usefulness of the system and knowledge of PMTCT., RESULTS: regarding the simplicity measure, we verified that the registry books contain more than 30 variables. The system was 83\% flexible in maintaining functionality with the introduction of new health facilities in the system. The completeness of the data was 50\% and concordance of data from the register book and monthly reports was 89\%., CONCLUSION: the PMTCT SIS-MA is useful in supporting the collection, analysis, interpretation and continuous and systematic dissemination of health data that are used to define and monitor public health policies in Mozambique. However, continued efforts are needed to improve data quality to ensure that the SIS-MA can adequately monitor the PMTCT program and contribute to reduced vertical transmission.

Six (46\%) patients reported a side effect requiring a medication change and eight (62\%) had a side effect present at treatment completion. A standardized MDR TB supplemental surveillance form was well received by stakeholders whose feedback was critical to making modifications. The finalized form will be implemented nationally in 2020 and will provide MDR TB treatment and morbidity data in the United States to help ensure patients with MDR TB receive the most effective treatment regimens with the least toxic drugs.},

It is now composed of public and private networks and provides clinical, epidemiological and virological data from influenza-like illness (ILI), acute respiratory infection (ARI) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) cases. In line with the WHO Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework Morocco developed an action plan for strengthening the influenza surveillance system and implementing the PISA tool recommended by WHO. Computerization of the entire surveillance system is underway with support from CDC. The aim of the current evaluation is to assess the surveillance system's ability to sustain these improvements. Method(s): A comprehensive evaluation was undertaken using surveillance system attributes in accordance with CDC guidelines (2001) and a protocol developed during a training workshop organized by WHO EMRO and CDC in Tunisia in April 2018 and adapted thereafter to the Moroccan context. The evaluation covered pre- and post-pandemic periods extending from 2007 to 2019. Result(s): Final results of the assessment scores of nine surveillance system attributes (data quality and completeness, timeliness, representativeness, flexibility, stability, utility, simplicity, acceptability, and sustainability) were presented during the EMARIS workshop in November 2019. Conclusion(s): Evaluation results will be used to strengthen the current surveillance system and prepare it for PISA tool implementation and computerization in compliance with PIP objectives and IHR recommendations.},

  abstract = {An effective surveillance system is critical for the elimination of canine rabies in Latin America. Brazil has made substantial progress towards canine rabies elimination, but outbreaks still occurred in the last decade in two states. Brazil uses a health information system (SINAN) to record patients seeking post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) following contact with an animal suspected of having rabies. This study evaluated: (i) whether SINAN can be reliably used for rabies surveillance; (ii) if patients in Brazil are receiving appropriate PEP and (iii) the benefits of implementing the latest World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations on PEP. Analysing SINAN records from 2008 to 2017 reveals an average of 506,148 bite-injury patients/year [range: 437k-545k] in the country, equivalent to an incidence of 255 bite-injuries/100,000 people/year [range: 231-280]. The number of reports of bites from suspect rabid dogs generally increased over time. In most states, records from SINAN indicating a suspect rabid dog do not correlate with confirmed dog rabies cases reported to the Regional Information System for Epidemiological Surveillance of Rabies (SIRVERA) maintained by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). Analyses showed that in 2017, only 45\% of patients received appropriate PEP as indicated by the Brazilian Ministry of Health guidance. Implementation of the latest WHO guidance using an abridged intradermal post-exposure vaccination regimen including one precautionary dose for dog bites prior to observation would reduce the volume of vaccine required by up to 64\%, with potential for annual savings of over USD 6 million from reduced vaccine use. Our results highlight the need to improve the implementation of SINAN, including training of health workers responsible for delivering PEP using an Integrated Bite Case Management approach so that SINAN can serve as a reliable surveillance tool for canine rabies elimination.},

  abstract = {Objective To evaluate comparatively national-scale initiatives against zoonoses in LA countries through the adaptation of prospective evaluation. Materials and Methods The surveillance of events of interest in public health and the measures carried out were analyzed and the prospective evaluation method of Hae-geman was adapted, with five criteria: evaluation, relevance, efficacy, timeliness and sustainability; they were specified and applied qualitatively to measure the achieve-ment and effect of each of the initiatives; determining the effectiveness objectively and shortening the comparability time. Results The main objectives of zoonoses programs are to reduce morbidity and mor-tality, strengthen epidemiological surveillance and national capacity. Monitored events are classified into: viral, bacterial, parasitic and actions against poisonous animal bites and responsible pet ownership. Measures to control zoonoses include five activities: promotion, prevention, diagnosis, surveillance, and control. From the five criteria evaluated, it is inferred that the initiatives follow the recommendations of international regulations, include intersectoral collaboration and social co-respon-sibility, and are consistent with the objectives set and sustainable over time. Conclusions The prospective evaluation shows that the relevance of the programs is reflected in how the objectives are focused on the needs of society in the face of the risks of contagion of zoonotic diseases and the actions implemen-ted collaboratively aim to generate a positive impact with society and the ecosystem. {\copyright} 2021, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

  abstract = {Integrated surveillance systems for antimicrobial use (AMU) and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) require regular evaluation to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of the system. An important step in the evaluation is to choose an appropriate tool for the purpose of the evaluation. The "Integrated Surveillance System Evaluation" (ISSE) framework is a conceptual framework that was developed to evaluate One Health (OH) integration in surveillance system for AMU/AMR. This study aimed to evaluate the performance and value of integrated surveillance system for AMU/AMR in England by applying the ISSE framework, which was used to develop data collection protocols and define the study design. A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews was conducted to collect the data and analyse it thematically. Eighteen stakeholders from human, animal, food and environment sectors that are involved in AMU/AMR surveillance were interviewed. Four main themes emerged from the analysis: (1) Cross-sectoral integration in the surveillance system for AMU/AMR; (2) Production of OH outputs and outcomes; (3) Drivers and barriers to cross-sectoral collaboration; and 4) Need for more cross-sectoral collaboration. The findings showed that there were links between integrated surveillance information, decision making and interventions. However, there were only few OH examples, such as the UK AMR contingency plan, where the potential of cross-sectoral collaboration was fully exploited. A lot of the benefits described were related to the generation of information and increase in knowledge and understanding without links to how the information generated was used. While these intangible benefits have a value on their own, being able to link surveillance information and mitigation measures would help to enhance the value of integrated surveillance. In terms of improvement, the main areas identified were the development of more harmonised methods for data collection and analysis, provision of resources dedicated to cross-sectoral collaboration, improved coordination, and collection of surveillance data from the environment and from companion animals. By identifying links between OH surveillance information produced and various outputs and outcomes; this study helped to understand the wider benefits of integrated surveillance for AMU/AMR in England and provided insights on how the system could be improved and efficiency increased.

  abstract = {Botswana reoriented its malaria program towards elimination in 2010 due to a drastic reduction in confirmed malaria cases from 8056 in 2000 to 885 in 2009. The country has been recording incidence of less than 1 per 1000 population since 2011, reaching a low of 0.1 per 1000 population in 2019. Health facilities report weekly on aggregated indicators for priority diseases, including malaria, through the Integrated Disease Surveillance Response (IDSR) system. Since 2012, malaria cases have also been notified via a case-based surveillance (CBS) system that collects key data points from each confirmed malaria case. A surveillance assessment in 2015 found that Botswana's CBS system had low completeness, timeliness, and data quality, and that the existing paper and Excel-based systems made it difficult to use data for good decision making because data were not available in real time. As a result of recommendations from the assessment, a malaria real time reporting system using DHIS2 Tracker Capture (DHIS2) was rolled out in 2017. Data from 2012-16 were compared to downloaded CBS data from the malaria DHIS2 system collected in 2018. The analysis found that completeness of case residence (69\% vs. 100\%), case classification (93\% vs. 97\%) and travel history (68\% vs. 98\%) all increased statistically significantly at the p{$<$}0.001 level between baseline and 2018, the year after DHIS2 was rolled out. The difference between the IDSR and CBS systems dropped from 40\% in 2012-16 to under 5\% in 2018. Data audits, support, and mentorship visits post initial roll-out gave opportunities for refresher skills building, troubleshooting, entering missing data, and data analysis. This also gave opportunity for technical IT support. Challenges identified at these meetings included initial system bugs, suboptimal retention of knowledge from initial trainings and unclear roles and responsibilities among staff at district level. The findings from this analysis indicate that the rollout of DHIS2 improved completeness of CBS data enough to accurately inform targeting of elimination interventions, but continuous training and system improvements are needed to maintain gains.},

Against the backdrop of the recent geographical expansion of KFD, indicating the inadequacy of policy and surveillance systems, the present study was performed to evaluate the KFD surveillance system in Shivamogga., METHODS: US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for surveillance system evaluation were followed. Nine attributes of the system towards its objectives were evaluated in a mixed study in Shivamogga., RESULTS: Two of three medical officers and four of six health staff at the institutions visited were found to be untrained in KFD surveillance. Integrated disease surveillance formats did not capture KFD data. Surveillance (tick, monkey, human) was mostly driven by the Health Department. Some of the critical findings of the evaluations were the absence of an animal and entomological surveillance line list, non-standardized reporting formats for human suspects, varying delays in the time-to-test across laboratories (2-16 days), and a lack of systematic data-sharing practices. Significant issues that emerged in the interview were deforestation with a change in ecosystem dynamics, limited diagnostic capacity, non-availability of point-of-care tests, outdated surveillance guidelines, a confusing surveillance perimeter (5 km), non-existing co-ownership among stakeholders, limited vaccine production capacity, and inadequate operational research., CONCLUSIONS: The system should consider integrating a One Health approach with defined ownership of activities among stakeholders.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Rapid Risk Factor Surveillance System (RRFSS) is an ongoing population health survey conducted by a collaborating group of Ontario public health units. This formative evaluation examined the process effectiveness, collaboration, utility and cost-effectiveness of RRFSS during its first year of operation., METHODS: An Evaluation Framework was developed with reference to guidelines for evaluation of surveillance systems developed by the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The study focussed on evaluable performance areas in a young surveillance system and on information needed to inform stakeholder decisions about future participation and improvement. Data were collected through surveys and interviews of key informants in participating health units, non-participating health units, the survey research house, and the provincial health ministry., RESULTS: Findings documented early use and dissemination of RRFSS data in health units after less than a year of surveillance system operation, stakeholder perceptions overall of data impact and value, and satisfaction with system functioning. Challenges to effectiveness were documented concerning data analysis, barriers to data use, and sustainability. Performance improvement strategies were identified for survey implementation and supports, data use, system participation, and reduced costs., CONCLUSION: In its first year, RRFSS was an effective collaborative method to collect population data for public health program planning and evaluation. The evaluation provided valuable information on use, functioning, effectiveness, strategic issues and areas for improvement in a young surveillance system, created opportunities for stakeholder input into evaluation and planning, and provided a baseline for future evaluations.},

  abstract = {Animal health surveillance enables the detection and control of animal diseases including zoonoses. Under the EU-FP7 project RISKSUR, a survey was conducted in 11 EU Member States and Switzerland to describe active surveillance components in 2011 managed by the public or private sector and identify gaps and opportunities. Information was collected about hazard, target population, geographical focus, legal obligation, management, surveillance design, risk-based sampling, and multi-hazard surveillance. Two countries were excluded due to incompleteness of data. Most of the 664 components targeted cattle (26.7\%), pigs (17.5\%) or poultry (16.0\%). The most common surveillance objectives were demonstrating freedom from disease (43.8\%) and case detection (26.8\%). Over half of components applied risk-based sampling (57.1\%), but mainly focused on a single population stratum (targeted risk-based) rather than differentiating between risk levels of different strata (stratified risk-based). About a third of components were multi-hazard (37.3\%). Both risk-based sampling and multi-hazard surveillance were used more frequently in privately funded components. The study identified several gaps (e.g. lack of systematic documentation, inconsistent application of terminology) and opportunities (e.g. stratified risk-based sampling). The greater flexibility provided by the new EU Animal Health Law means that systematic evaluation of surveillance alternatives will be required to optimize cost-effectiveness.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Germany has a mandatory surveillance system for acute hepatitis B (AHB) with the Protection against Infection Act as the legal basis in place since 2001. An amendment was introduced in 2013. We aimed at evaluating the surveillance systems' performance regarding timeliness, data quality, and simplicity from 2005 to 2014 and at assessing the effect of the amendment on timeliness of AHB surveillance. Study design: This study is a trend analysis of surveillance data. Method(s): Aspects of simplicity versus complexity of the surveillance system were assessed by describing data flow, levels of reporting, and data management procedures. Data quality, in terms of data completeness, was evaluated by quantitative indicators, and timeliness was measured in days between different levels of the surveillance system, notification delay, and reporting delay. Trends over time in data quality were analyzed by logistic regression, while negative binomial regression was used to test for trend over time regarding mean notification and reporting delay. Result(s): Between January 2005 and December 2014, a total of 22,549 AHB infections were reported at the national level. The data flow of the German AHB surveillance system showed structural characteristics of a complex system. Over the 10-year period, completeness of reporting sex, age, probable route of transmission, and hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination were 99\%, 100\%, 25\%, and 73\%, respectively. However, data quality decreased over the evaluation period. Although notification delay improved over time (incident rate ratio [IRR] = 0.95, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.95-0.96; P {$<$} 0.05), reporting delay improved only since the amendment (IRR = 0.76, 95\% CI = 0.70-0.82; P {$<$} 0.05). In total, mean notification and reporting delay were 3.0 days and 14.3 days, respectively. Conclusion(s): The German AHB surveillance system is operating in a timely manner. Although timeliness improved over the evaluation period and the amendment to the Protection against Infection Act succeeded in reducing reporting time, data quality in terms of completeness of information decreased considerably. As improved data completeness is required to adequately design prevention activities, reasons for this decrease should further be explored.Copyright {\copyright} 2019 The Royal Society for Public Health},

We describe an approach to examining the representativeness of a single sentinel site employed for campylobacteriosis surveillance and source attribution, utilizing a selection of data sources and statistical comparisons of demographic, epidemiological and pathogen genotyping data across selected regions of New Zealand. Our findings showed that while this region captured the national variability in many variables, for example by containing sizable urban and rural populations, the relative frequency of these features did vary from other regions of New Zealand. We discuss the value of choosing a sentinel site that represents the national distribution of key variables, compared to a site that captures the broad features of the wider population, but provides greater power for the monitoring of sub-populations.},

  abstract = {The international community and governmental organizations are actively calling for the implementation of One Health (OH) surveillance systems to target health hazards that involve humans, animals, and their environment. In our view, the main characteristic of a OH surveillance system is the collaboration across institutions and disciplines operating within the different sectors to plan, coordinate, and implement the surveillance process. However, the multisectoral organizational models and possible collaborative modalities implemented throughout the surveillance process are multi-fold and depend on the objective and context of the surveillance. The purpose of this study is to define a matrix to evaluate the quality and appropriateness of multisectoral collaboration through an in-depth analysis of its organization, implementation, and functions. We developed a first list of evaluation attributes based on (i) the characteristics of the organization, implementation, and functionality of multisectoral surveillance systems; and (ii) the existing attributes for the evaluation of health surveillance systems and OH initiatives. These attributes were submitted to two rounds of expert-opinion elicitation for review and validation. The final list of attributes consisted of 23 organizational attributes and 9 functional attributes, to which 3 organizational indexes were added measuring the overall organization of collaboration. We then defined 75 criteria to evaluate the level of satisfaction for the attributes and indexes. The criteria were scored following a four-tiered scoring grid. Graphical representations allowed for an easy overview of the evaluation results for both attributes and indexes. This evaluation matrix is the first to allow an in-depth analysis of collaboration in a multisectoral surveillance system and is the preliminary step toward the creation of a fully standalone tool for the evaluation of collaboration. After its practical application and adaptability to different contexts are field-tested, this tool could be very useful in identifying the strengths and weaknesses of collaboration occurring in a multisectoral surveillance system.},

  abstract = {In line with the One Health concept, international organizations and the scientific community are strongly supporting the implementation of multisectoral surveillance systems in an attempt to improve the management of health hazards at the human-animal-environment interface. Such surveillance systems call for the establishment of collaboration across sectors and disciplines that must be evaluated to ensure they are appropriate and functional to produce the expected results. In this context, we have developed a tool, ECoSur (Evaluation of Collaboration for surveillance), to evaluate the organization, functioning, and functionalities of collaboration taking place in a multisectoral surveillance system. ECoSur relies on 22 attributes characterizing the organization of collaboration at the governance and operation level and nine attributes referring to core functions of collaboration to ensure the sustainable operation of an effective multisectoral surveillance system. Along with these attributes, three indexes allow for the characterization of the organization of collaboration at a macro level according to three processes: management, support, and operation. Attributes are evaluated based on the scoring of criteria that contribute to their definition. Once scores are captured in a spreadsheet, evaluation results are automatically generated. Their interpretation supports the identification of strengths and weaknesses of collaboration and the formulation of recommendations for its amelioration. {\copyright} Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

  abstract = {The concept of One Health (OH) promotes the decompartmentalisation of human, animal, and ecosystem health for the more efficient and sustainable governance of complex  health issues. This means that traditional boundaries between disciplines and  sectors must be transgressed and that all relevant stakeholders must be involved in  the definition and management of health problems. International efforts have been  made to strengthen collaboration across sectors and disciplines and OH surveillance  is strongly encouraged at global, national and local-level to efficiently manage  hazards involving humans, animals and ecosystems. This concept is intuitively  appealing and would suggest the enhanced performance and cost-effectiveness of  surveillance systems, as compared to more conventional approaches. Nevertheless,  confusion and uncertainty regarding the practical application, outcomes and impacts  prevail. We believe that this is due to the lack of a conceptual and methodological  framework which would (i) define the characteristics of OH surveillance, and (ii)  identify the appropriate mechanisms for inter-sectoral and multi-disciplinary  collaboration, to ensure that the surveillance system performs well, with regard to  the objective, the context and the health hazard under surveillance. The objective  of the study is to define the organisational and functional characteristics of OH  surveillance systems, the context in which they are implemented, as well as the  influential factors which may obstruct or support their implementation and  performance. To achieve this, a systematic literature review of existing OH  surveillance systems was conducted using the Prisma guidelines. The selected systems  were assessed according to 38 predetermined variables. These allowed the  characterisation of their objectives, organisation, functioning, performance and  benefits. Data extraction was conducted using a spreadsheet and a database was built  using an electronic multiple-choice questionnaire. The literature search identified  a total of 1635 records. After the screening phase, 31 references were kept and 22  additional references retrieved from bibliographies were added. From these 53  selected documents, we retrieved 41 different surveillance systems in line with the  definition proposed in this study. The analysis of this database enabled the  identification of different dimensions and areas of collaboration. Barriers and  levers for the implementation of OH surveillance systems were also identified and  discussed. Based on our results, we propose a framework to characterise the  organisation of collaboration for the governance and operation of an effective OH  surveillance system.},

Qualitative and quantitative data collection was carried out in the year 2015 with cross-sectional survey design in western states of India. The in-depth interviews of 10 stakeholders, structured interviews of the survey respondents (n = 560), and field investigators (n = 71) were conducted. Data triangulation was used to find out the concurrence of the qualitative and quantitative data., RESULTS: Comprehensive and standardized survey questionnaire, structured training agenda, and strategic preparation for recruiting human resources were the overall strengths of the survey. However, during the implementation of the survey, there were some difficulties reported in data collection process. Overall, the respondents and investigators felt that the questionnaire was long and exhaustive. Difficulties were faced while collecting data on sexual history. The field staffs were not adequately experienced to work with sensitive population., CONCLUSIONS: In order to have accurate, reliable data, especially on sexual behavior; emphasis should be given on simple questionnaire with the use of community-friendly language, skilled and experienced interviewers for data collection, and extensive field training.},

The quality of surveillance information is important for public health decision making. Our objective was to describe the system and evaluate it for data completeness and timeliness., METHODS: Cases reported in the surveillance system from 2004 to 2016 were included. For the notification data, we used information on serogroup, vaccination status, mortality, and country of infection as indicators for record completeness. Notification times to regional and national level were calculated using the reported dates available in the notification database., RESULTS: A total of 2123 cases were reported in the years 2004-2016, of which 1.968 (93\%) were reported by the reference laboratory and 1.995 (94\%) in the notification system. Of all cases, 1.840 cases (87\%) were reported in both systems and could be linked. The serogroup was known in 86\% of the notified cases, and was significantly higher (94\%) in the years 2013-2016. Information on vaccination status, mortality and country of infection was available in 88, 99 and 97\% of notified cases, respectively. Regional notification of cases occurred within one working day for 86\% of cases and 98\% were notified nationally within three days., CONCLUSIONS: A well performing IMD surveillance system was demonstrated and serogroup completeness has improved over the years. Underlining the need for reporting to both the clinical and laboratory surveillance system remains important to further improve the overall performance in supporting public health response and vaccination policy.},

Design: Descriptive secondary data analysis. Setting: Bawku Municipality. Data Source: Review VHF surveillance records, interviewed community-based surveillance volunteers (CBSVs) and reviewed vital events registers. We also assessed the system attributes by reviewing records and interviewing key stakeholders involved in VHF surveillance system with focus on Ebola using checklist and semi structured questionnaire developed based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. Main outcome measure: System attributes of the VHF surveillance system Results: Population under surveillance was 105,849. The system required detail information about suspected cases. However, it had a simple and clear standard case definitions, and was well integrated with the IDSR. There is a regular and timely flow of information. The system captured 155 suspected cases nationwide from 2011 to 2015 and all tested negative. Of these, Upper East Region reported 10 suspected cases including 4 suspected cases from Bawku Municipality. Conclusion: The VHF surveillance system achieved its objectives. However, poor data quality, inadequately trained surveillance officers, and inadequate financial support are threats to the effectiveness of the system.},

  abstract = {Bovine abortion is the main clinical sign of bovine brucellosis, a disease of which France has been declared officially free since 2005. To ensure the early detection of any brucellosis outbreak, event-driven surveillance relies on the mandatory notification of bovine abortions and the brucellosis testing of aborting cows. However, the under-reporting of abortions appears frequent. Our objectives were to assess the aptitude of the bovine abortion surveillance system to detect each and every bovine abortion and to identify factors influencing the system's effectiveness. We evaluated five attributes defined by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control with a method suited to each attribute: (1) data quality was studied quantitatively and qualitatively, as this factor considerably influences data analysis and results; (2) sensitivity and representativeness were estimated using a unilist capture-recapture approach to quantify the surveillance system's effectiveness; (3) acceptability and simplicity were studied through qualitative interviews of actors in the field, given that the surveillance system relies heavily on abortion notifications by farmers and veterinarians. Our analysis showed that (1) data quality was generally satisfactory even though some errors might be due to actors' lack of awareness of the need to collect accurate data; (2) from 2006 to 2011, the mean annual sensitivity - i.e. the proportion of farmers who reported at least one abortion out of all those who detected such events - was around 34\%, but was significantly higher in dairy than beef cattle herds (highlighting a lack of representativeness); (3) overall, the system's low sensitivity was related to its low acceptability and lack of simplicity. This study showed that, in contrast to policy-makers, most farmers and veterinarians perceived the risk of a brucellosis outbreak as negligible. They did not consider sporadic abortions as a suspected case of brucellosis and usually reported abortions only to identify their cause rather than to reject brucellosis. The system proved too complex, especially for beef cattle farmers, as they may fail to detect aborting cows at pasture or have difficulties catching them for sampling. By investigating critical attributes, our evaluation highlighted the surveillance system's strengths and needed improvements. We believe our comprehensive approach can be used to assess other event-driven surveillance systems. In addition, some of our recommendations on increasing the effectiveness of event-driven brucellosis surveillance may be useful in improving the notification rate for suspected cases of other exotic diseases.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The World Health Organisation recommends outpatient influenza-like illness (ILI) and inpatient severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) surveillance. We evaluated two influenza surveillance systems in South Africa: one for ILI and another for SARI., METHODOLOGY: The Viral Watch (VW) programme has collected virological influenza surveillance data voluntarily from patients with ILI since 1984 in private and public clinics in all 9 South African provinces. The SARI surveillance programme has collected epidemiological and virological influenza surveillance data since 2009 in public hospitals in 4 provinces by dedicated personnel. We compared nine surveillance system attributes from 2009-2012., RESULTS: We analysed data from 18,293 SARI patients and 9,104 ILI patients. The annual proportion of samples testing positive for influenza was higher for VW (mean 41\%) than SARI (mean 8\%) and generally exceeded the seasonal threshold from May to September (VW: weeks 21-40; SARI: weeks 23-39). Data quality was a major strength of SARI (most data completion measures {$>$}90\%; adherence to definitions: 88-89\%) and a relative weakness of the VW programme (62\% of forms complete, with limited epidemiologic data collected; adherence to definitions: 65-82\%). Timeliness was a relative strength of both systems (e.g. both collected {$>$}93\% of all respiratory specimens within 7 days of symptom onset). ILI surveillance was more nationally representative, financially sustainable and expandable than the SARI system. Though the SARI programme is not nationally representative, the high quality and detail of SARI data collection sheds light on the local burden and epidemiology of severe influenza-associated disease., CONCLUSIONS: To best monitor influenza in South Africa, we propose that both ILI and SARI should be under surveillance. Improving ILI surveillance will require better quality and more systematic data collection, and SARI surveillance should be expanded to be more nationally representative, even if this requires scaling back on information gathered.}

The detection of a bioterrorism-related epidemic will depend on population characteristics, availability and use of health services, the nature of an attack, epidemiologic features of individual diseases, surveillance methods, and the capacity of health departments to respond to alerts. Predicting how these factors will combine in a bioterrorism attack may be impossible. Nevertheless, understanding their likely effect on epidemic detection should help define the usefulness of syndromic surveillance and identify approaches to increasing the likelihood that clinicians recognize and report an epidemic.},

For automated surveillance, we programmed a query against our Enterprise Data Vault (EDV) for cases of IAH. The EDV query was established as a dynamic data source to feed our data visualization software, automatically updating every 24 hours.To establish a gold standard of cases of IAH against which to evaluate the performance of manual and automated surveillance systems, we generated a master list of possible IAH by querying four independent information systems. We reviewed medical records and adjudicated whether each possible case represented a true case of IAH., RESULTS: We found 844 true cases of IAH, 577 (68.4\%) of which were detected by the manual system and 774 (91.7\%) of which were detected by the automated system. The positive predictive values of the manual and automated systems were 89.3 and 88.3\%, respectively.Relying on the automated surveillance system for IAH resulted in an average recoup of 82 minutes per day for each IP and an estimated system-wide payroll redirection of \$32,880 over the four heaviest weeks of influenza activity., CONCLUSION: Surveillance for IAH can be entirely automated at multihospital health systems, saving time, and money while improving case detection.

  abstract = {CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) surveillance in Belgium is essential to maintain the officially free status and to preserve animal and public health. An evaluation of the system is thus needed to ascertain the surveillance provides a precise description of the current situation in the country. The evaluation should assess stakeholders' perceptions and expectations about the system due to the fact that the acceptability has an influence on the levels of sensitivity and timeliness of the surveillance system. The objective of the study was to assess the acceptability of the bTB surveillance in Belgium, using participatory tools and the OASIS flash tool ('analysis tool for surveillance systems')., METHODS: For the participatory process, focus group discussions and individual interviews were implemented with representatives involved with the system, both from cattle and wildlife part of the surveillance. Three main tools were used: (i) relational diagrams associated with smileys, (ii) flow diagrams associated with proportional piling, and (iii) impact diagrams associated with proportional piling. A total of six criteria were assessed, among which five were scored on a scale from -1 to +1. For the OASIS flash tool, one full day meeting with representatives from stakeholders involved with the surveillance was organised. A total of 19 criteria linked to acceptability were scored on a scale from 0 to 3., RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Both methods highlighted a medium acceptability of the bTB surveillance. The main elements having a negative influence were the consequences of official notification of a bTB suspect case in a farm, the low remuneration paid to private veterinarians for execution of intradermal tuberculin tests and the practical difficulties about the containment of the animals. Based on the two evaluation processes, relevant recommendations to improve the surveillance were made. Based on the comparison between the two evaluation processes, the added value of the participatory approach was highlighted.},

The complex nature of these systems and the variable contexts in which they are implemented call for the development of flexible evaluation tools. Within this scope, participatory tools have been developed and implemented for the African swine fever (ASF) surveillance system in Corsica (France). The objectives of this pilot study were, firstly, to assess the applicability of participatory approaches within a developed environment involving various stakeholders and, secondly, to define and test methods developed to assess evaluation attributes. Two evaluation attributes were targeted: the acceptability of the surveillance system and its the non-monetary benefits. Individual semi-structured interviews and focus groups were implemented with representatives from every level of the system. Diagramming and scoring tools were used to assess the different elements that compose the definition of acceptability. A contingent valuation method, associated with proportional piling, was used to assess the non-monetary benefits, i.e., the value of sanitary information. Sixteen stakeholders were involved in the process, through 3 focus groups and 8 individual semi-structured interviews. Stakeholders were selected according to their role in the system and to their availability. Results highlighted a moderate acceptability of the system for farmers and hunters and a high acceptability for other representatives (e.g., private veterinarians, local laboratories). Out of the 5 farmers involved in assessing the non-monetary benefits, 3 were interested in sanitary information on ASF. The data collected via participatory approaches enable relevant recommendations to be made, based on the Corsican context, to improve the current surveillance system.

  abstract = {Early detection surveillance is used for various purposes, including the early detection of non-communicable diseases (e.g. cancer screening), of unusual increases of disease frequency (e.g. influenza or pertussis outbreaks), and the first occurrence of a disease in a previously free population. This latter purpose is particularly important due to the high consequences and cost of delayed detection of a disease moving to a new population. Quantifying the sensitivity of early detection surveillance allows important aspects of the performance of different systems, approaches and authorities to be evaluated, compared and improved. While quantitative evaluation of the sensitivity of other branches of surveillance has been available for many years, development has lagged in the area of early detection, arguably one of the most important purposes of surveillance. This paper, using mostly animal health examples, develops a simple approach to quantifying the sensitivity of early detection surveillance, in terms of population coverage, temporal coverage and detection sensitivity. This approach is extended to quantify the benefits of risk-based approaches to early detection surveillance. Population-based clinical surveillance (based on either farmers and their veterinarians, or patients and their local health services) provides the best combination of sensitivity, practicality and cost-effectiveness. These systems can be significantly enhanced by removing disincentives to reporting, for instance by implementing effective strategies to improve farmer awareness and engagement with health services and addressing the challenges of well-intentioned disease notification policies that inadvertently impose barriers to reporting.},

  abstract = {Malaria transmission throughout Mozambique is extremely variable, with prevalence ranging as high as 68\% in the north, to below 3\% in the south. As a result, the country is simultaneously pursuing elimination in the south of the country and addressing high burden areas in the north. Reorienting the routine health information system (HIS) for malaria such that it addresses the needs of the different transmission levels is a challenge, yet one that is vital to eventually achieving elimination. In order to help the country tailor their system to the unique epidemiology of the country, an assessment of the passive surveillance systems in the country was conducted. This assessment consisted of both qualitative and quantitative methods involving documentation review, key stakeholder interviews from the central to the community level, and data analysis to evaluate the performance of the system including key indicators such as timeliness and completeness of the system. Although the study found high acceptability at health facilities in the country, a number of weaknesses were also identified. Specifically, a lack of standardized reporting tools was found at the health facility and district levels, along with poor integration of other malaria indicators into the HIS. Availability and timeliness were also low, due to poor internet connectivity and long delays ({$>$} 3 months) in reporting, respectively. Data quality issues, including accuracy and completeness, were also found to be major gaps, as was poor data use and the lack of a case-based system to support elimination efforts. In response to this assessment, it was recommended that the country ensure the use of a standardized set of collection tools and that the availability of these tools is guaranteed, and that the IT infrastructure and data management capacity of districts and provinces be strengthened to improve data quality. Finally, in order to support ongoing elimination efforts in the country, it was recommended that the program create a case-based surveillance system with timely case notification, investigation and classification, active case detection when required, and foci investigation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis with laboratory confirmation has been a key strategy in the global polio eradication initiative, and the laboratory platform established for polio testing has been expanded in many countries to include surveillance for cases of febrile rash illness to identify measles and rubella cases. Vaccine-preventable disease surveillance is essential to detect outbreaks, define disease burden, guide vaccination strategies and assess immunization impact. Vaccines now exist to prevent Japanese encephalitis (JE) and some etiologies of bacterial meningitis., METHODS: We evaluated the feasibility of expanding polio-measles surveillance and laboratory networks to detect bacterial meningitis and JE, using surveillance for acute meningitis-encephalitis syndrome in Bangladesh and China and acute encephalitis syndrome in India. We developed nine syndromic surveillance performance indicators based on international surveillance guidelines and calculated scores using supervisory visit reports, annual reports, and case-based surveillance data., RESULTS: Scores, variable by country and targeted disease, were highest for the presence of national guidelines, sustainability, training, availability of JE laboratory resources, and effectiveness of using polio-measles networks for JE surveillance. Scores for effectiveness of building on polio-measles networks for bacterial meningitis surveillance and specimen referral were the lowest, because of differences in specimens and techniques., CONCLUSIONS: Polio-measles surveillance and laboratory networks provided useful infrastructure for establishing syndromic surveillance and building capacity for JE diagnosis, but were less applicable for bacterial meningitis. Laboratory-supported surveillance for vaccine-preventable bacterial diseases will require substantial technical and financial support to enhance local diagnostic capacity.

  abstract = {Background: Yellow fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic disease caused by the yellow fever virus. There is no specific treatment for yellow fever; only supportive treatment is available to manage symptoms. Without treatment, up to 50\% of severely affected persons die. Yellow fever surveillance system in Adaklu District has never been an evaluated. We evaluated the yellow fever surveillance system in Adaklu District to determine whether the system meets its objectives and assess its attributes. Methods and materials: We used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated guidelines 2001, to evaluate the system. Secondary data was obtained from district health information management system database from 2014-2018, reports and case based forms. We interviewed key stakeholders involved in yellow fever surveillance using semi-structured questionnaires. We performed summary descriptive analysis on quantitative data, and directed content analysis on qualitative data. We presented the results in tables and charts. Result(s): From 2014 through 2018, 22 suspected cases reported. The highest proportion of cases (36.3\%) reported in 2018. Most of the suspected cases 63.6\% were male. Completeness of data on case based forms after laboratory investigation was 76.9\%. Suspected cases of yellow fever not recorded in consulting room registers in 2017 and 2018. The completeness of weekly reporting was 71.8\% in 2014 and 100\% in 2018. Timeliness of weekly reporting was 8.2\% in 2014 and 97.9\% in 2018. Proportion of facilities that reported case in the district increased from 26\% in 2017 to 40\% in 2018. District met 80\% target samples reaching laboratory in adequate condition. Feedback on specimen tested within seven days after the receipt was 45.4\%. Conclusion(s): The yellow fever surveillance system partially met its objectives. The system is useful and sensitive. Data quality, timely feedback needs improvement. Clinicians sensitized on the importance of recording patient information on registers and monitor trend of yellow fever.Copyright {\copyright} 2020},

Completeness was assessed by examining the field completion of key variables and median time from diagnosis to notification was calculated to evaluate timeliness. Differences between the two systems on completeness and timeliness were statistically assessed using chi2 and Wilcoxon rank-sum test, respectively. An online questionnaire on simplicity, flexibility and usefulness was sent to key stakeholders. Time and diagnosis-related variables were more complete in NTBSS, while variables on drug susceptibility, HIV and laboratory tests were more complete in CIDR (P {$<$} 0.05). The median time notification interval increased significantly in CIDR (P {$<$} 0.05). Stakeholders thought that CIDR is simpler (37.5\%), more useful (41.7\%) and more flexible (29.2\%) than NTBSS. This study demonstrated that CIDR did not improve data completeness and decreased timeliness of notification. Simplicity, usefulness and flexibility were improved but qualitative methods should be applied to further explore these results.Copyright {\copyright} 2018 Cambridge University Press.},

In the following years the virus spread to new areas, with a total of 76 WNND cases in 2011, and 109 WNND cases in 2012 (14 and 12 WNND cases, respectively, in Central Macedonia). We established a surveillance system based on serological testing of domestic pigeons, using cELISA confirmed by serum neutralization test. In Central Macedonia, pigeon seroprevalence was 54\% (95\% CI: 49-59\%) and 31\% (95\% CI: 24-37\%) at the end of the 2010 and 2011 epidemic seasons, respectively. One serum was positive for neutralizing antibodies directed against Usutu virus. Pigeon WNV seroprevalence and incidence rates of human WNND after the 2010 epidemic were positively correlated (rho=0.94, at the regional unit level), while in 2011 the correlation (rho=0.56) was not statistically significant, possibly due to small number of human WNND cases recorded. To evaluate the efficacy of the system at alerting upon WNV enzootic circulation before the onset of human cases, we tested 270 pigeons in 2011 and 240 pigeons in 2012. In Central Macedonia, the first seroconversions in pigeons were recorded 44 and 47 days, respectively, before the first human WNND cases. Pigeon surveillance was used successfully for identification of areas with WNV enzootic transmission and for early warning. Timely diffusion of information to health authorities facilitated the implementation of preparedness plans to protect public health. Copyright {\copyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Respondents ranked timeliness as the most important attribute of surveillance reports, followed by data completeness. Among 6 annual reports reviewed, the median time to publication was 11.5 months compared with 23.2 months for PHO., CONCLUSION: Recommendations based on this evaluation have already been applied to the monthly report (eg, focusing on the most useful sections) and have become key considerations when developing future annual reports and other surveillance reporting tools (eg, need to provide more timely reports). Other public health organizations may also use this evaluation to inform aspects of their surveillance report development and evaluation. The evaluation results have provided PHO with direction on how to improve its provincial infectious disease surveillance reporting moving forward, and formed a basis for future work in surveillance product development and evaluation.},

The state health department provided a grant, guide, and training for health districts to implement the program and report quarterly and annually to the M\&E. Some health districts did not meet this requirement. We also found that the M\&E did not adequately capture the actual work of the districts in communities as related to the work plan. We identified several factors that negatively affected the performances of the M\&E. For example, the state and health districts did not have a shared vision on how to develop and implement the program, and what to report to the M\&E. We proposed strategies that could improve the timeliness and content of reports to the M\&E, as well as its utilization in the future. Copyright {\copyright} 2019. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Methods: The data was obtained from a series of management systems included the influenza surveillance, the epidemic outbreak monitoring and the etiology monitoring of the network laboratory and from the reports of the cases of influenza like illness (ILI) as well as the samples of collecting and delivering and so on. The data was used to evaluate the basis of The National Evaluation Schemes of the Quality for the Influenza Surveillance (2012 edition). Results: From 2013 to 2015, the index of the quality for influenza surveillance in Zhaoqing was good and only 33\% (7/21) positive specimens from the epidemic outbreak monitoring were performed with the viral isolation. There were only 59.46\% (198/333) positive specimens were performed with the identification of subtypes from 2013 to 2014. The index of the timeliness of strain inspection from chicken embryos separation was the weakest point from 2014 to 2015. The ratio of timely reporting of ILI in the municipal level fell from 93.46\% to 84.62\% and was lower than that in the national level (X2=11.469, P{$<$}0.001). There were two weeks' specimens that did not conform to the quantitative requirement and six specimens failed to be timely inspected. Conclusion: The quality of the work for influenza surveillance management was good. But the work for the viral isolation and delivery of specimens from the epidemic outbreak monitoring, the report of ILI and the collection and inspection of specimens was insufficient. We should take measures to improve it timely.},

Traditional surveillance methods involving manual surveillance by infection control practitioners (ICPs) for data collection processes are laborious, inefficient, and generate data of variable quality. In this study, we sought to evaluate the impact of surveillance and interaction platform system (SIPS) for HAIs surveillance compared to manual survey in tertiary general hospitals. Method(s): A large multi-center study including 21 tertiary general hospitals and 63 wards were performed to evaluate the impact of electronic SIPS for HAIs. Result(s): We collected 4,098 consecutive patients and found that the hospitals installed with SIPS significantly increased work efficiency of ICPs achieving satisfactory diagnostic performance of HAIs with 0.73 for sensitivity, 0.81 for specificity and 0.81 area under the curve (AUC). However, there were significant heterogeneity own to regions, time of SIPS installation, departments and sample size. Conclusion(s): SIPS significantly improved ICPs efficiency and HAIs monitoring effectiveness, but there were shortcomings such as untimely maintenance and high cost.Copyright {\copyright} Annals of Translational Medicine.

Methods: Using data from the project of the monitoring system of leprosy suspicious symptoms during 2012-2015, the health economic evaluation of the monitoring system was conducted by the cost-effectiveness analysis, cost-utility analysis and cost-benefit analysis. Results: 314318 yuan had been invested in the system during 2012-2015. The economic evaluation suggested 34924.22 yuan would be spent once diagnosing one leprosy case, 974.39 yuan would be spent once shortening one month of the delayed diagnosis, 41837.9 yuan would be spent once avoiding one case of misdiagnosis, and 150616.5 yuan would be spent once avoiding one case of grade II disabilities. The average time of delayed diagnosis was shortened by 34.35 months, and the average frequency of misdiagnosis was reduced by 0.8 times. 2 cases of grade II disabilities were avoided, and DALY of 72.64 years was retrieved. The social total value of 3860777.5 yuan was saved, the net benefit was 3546459.5 yuan, and the cost-benefit ratio was 12.28.

Data were collected by means of a questionnaire based on the model of World Health Organization evaluation forms. These questionnaires were administered to personnel in charge of epidemiological surveillance in the health districts and the personnel of district hospitals and health centres., RESULTS: The AEFI monitoring system, apart from its simplicity and flexibility, remains fairly ineffective due to the relatively low acceptability by all health workers involved. Only 4\% of healthcare personnel respondents participate in this activity; 55\% of health districts reported cases of AEFI and 25\% of health centres reported cases of adverse events. The low acceptability makes this system less sensitive and ineffective for health policy decision-making designed to reduce adverse events following immunization., CONCLUSION: Improved performance of the AEFI monitoring system requires better training of health workers, better data processing equipment and improved community participation.},

Different figures of cholera were reported through weekly rapid disease notification system with 106 patients and Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NDSS) with 111 patients, causing data discrepancy. We evaluated the NDSS to determine reasons for underperformance and data discrepancy., Methods: we conducted descriptive cross-sectional study using updated centres for disease control and prevention guidelines for surveillance system evaluation. We recruited forty-six health workers. Interviewer-administered questionnaires and checklists were used to collect data on reasons for underperformance, reasons for data discrepancy, knowledge of NDSS, surveillance system attributes and usefulness. Epi InfoTM7 generated frequencies, proportions, and means. Likert scale was used to assess health worker knowledge., Results: of the forty-six health workers, 34 (78\%) had fair knowledge of NDSS. The reason for system underperformance was lack of training in NDSS 42 (91\%). Data discrepancy was attributed to typographical mistakes made during data entry on WhatsApp platform 32 (70\%). Eighty per cent (37) were willing to complete T1 forms. Six participants who were timed took ten minutes to complete T1 forms. Among 17 health facilities, only three had fifteen T1 forms that were adequate to notify first five cases in an outbreak. Notifiable diseases surveillance system data was used for planning health education 28 (68\%)., Conclusion: the NDSS was unstable due to health workers' inadequate knowledge and unavailability of T1 forms. Notifiable diseases surveillance system was found to be simple, acceptable, and useful. We recommended NDSS training of health workers. Copyright: Memory Chimsimbe et al.},

  abstract = {Background: Chronic diseases are now a major health problem in developing countries as well as in the developed world. Although chronic diseases cannot be communicated from person to person, their risk factors (for example, smoking, inactivity, dietary habits) are readily transferred around the world. With increasing human progress and technological advance, the pandemic of chronic diseases will become an even bigger threat to global health. Methods: Based on our experiences and publications as well as review of the literature, we contribute ideas and working examples that might help enhance global capacity in the surveillance of chronic diseases and their prevention and control. Innovative ideas and solutions were actively sought. Results: Ideas and working examples to help enhance global capacity were grouped under seven themes, concisely summarised by the acronym "SCIENCE": Strategy, Collaboration, Information, Education, Novelty, Communication and Evaluation. Conclusion: Building a basis for action using the seven themes articulated, especially by incorporating innovative ideas, we presented here, can help enhance global capacity in chronic disease surveillance, prevention and control. Informed initiatives can help achieve the new World Health Organization global goal of reducing chronic disease death rates by 2\% annually, generate new ideas for effective interventions and ultimately bring global chronic diseases under greater control.},

In the four provinces studied, 80 health centres were systematically selected. A total of 80 health officers, 183 health volunteers and 1,200 caretakers were interviewed and tested for GMP knowledge and practices. One-fourth of the health officers and half of the volunteers did not understand the objectives of the GMP. More than half of the health officers and volunteers did not have the skill to weigh properly. About half of the volunteers could not plot and explain the growth chart correctly. Only 40\% of the caretakers understand the growth chart. Documentation of weight on child health card is lacking. We recommend adequate trainings and supervisions for health officers and volunteers, revised GMP guidelines to enhance integration with other programmes, and a study to identify the effectiveness of the GMP.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 2016-2017, Vietnam's Ministry of Health (MoH) implemented an event-based surveillance (EBS) pilot project in six provinces as part of Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) efforts. This manuscript describes development and design of tools for monitoring and evaluation (M\&E) of EBS in Vietnam., METHODS: A strategic EBS framework was developed based on the EBS implementation pilot project's goals and objectives. The main process and outcome components were identified and included input, activities, outputs, and outcome indicators. M\&E tools were developed to collect quantitative and qualitative data. The tools included a supervisory checklist, a desk review tool, a key informant interview guide, a focus group discussion guide, a timeliness form, and an online acceptability survey. An evaluation team conducted field visits for assessment of EBS 5-9 months after implementation., RESULTS: The quantitative data collected provided evidence on the number and type of events that were being reported, the timeliness of the system, and the event-to-signal ratio. The qualitative and subjective data collected helped to increase understanding of the system's field utility and acceptance by field staff, reasons for non-compliance with established guidelines, and other factors influencing implementation., CONCLUSIONS: The use of M\&E tools for the EBS pilot project in Vietnam provided data on signals and events reported, timeliness of reporting and response, perceptions and opinions of implementers, and fidelity of EBS implementation. These data were valuable for Vietnam's MoH to understand the function of the EBS program, and the success and challenges of implementing this project in Vietnam.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Australia is traditionally an early adopter of vaccines, therefore comprehensive and effective post-licensure vaccine pharmacovigilance is critical to maintain confidence in immunisation, both nationally and internationally. With adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) surveillance the responsibility of Australian jurisdictions, Victoria operates an enhanced passive AEFI surveillance system integrated with clinical services, called `SAEFVIC' (Surveillance of Adverse Events Following Vaccination In the Community). Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate Victoria's current AEFI surveillance system `SAEFVIC' and inform ongoing quality improvement of vaccine pharmacovigilance in Victoria and Australia. Methods: We conducted a retrospective structured desktop evaluation of AEFI reporting received by SAEFVIC from 2007 to 2014, to evaluate the system according to its stated objectives, i.e. to improve AEFI reporting; provide AEFI signal detection; and to maintain consumer confidence in vaccination. Results: AEFI reporting has tripled since SAEFVIC commenced (incidence risk ratio [IRR] 3.04, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 2.35--3.93), raising Victoria to be the lead jurisdiction by AEFI reporting volume and to rank third by population reporting rate nationally. The largest increase was observed in children. Data were utilised to investigate potential signal events and inform vaccine policy. Signal detection required clinical suspicion by surveillance nurses, or prior vaccine-specific concerns. Subsequent vaccination post-AEFI was documented for 56.2\% (95\% CI 54.1--58.4)~of reports, and the proportion of children due or overdue for vaccination was 2.3\% higher for those reporting AEFI compared with the general population. Conclusion: SAEFVIC has improved AEFI surveillance, facilitates signal investigation and validation, and supports consumer confidence in immunisation. Expansion of the system nationally has the potential to improve capacity and capability of vaccine pharmacovigilance, particularly through data consistency and jurisdictional comparability in Australia. {\copyright} 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of a novel malaria outbreak identification system in the epidemic prone rural area of Mpumalanga Province, South Africa, for timely identification of malaria outbreaks and guiding integrated public health responses., METHODS: Using five years of historical notification data, two binomial thresholds were determined for each primary health care facility in the highest malaria risk area of Mpumalanga province. Whenever the thresholds were exceeded at health facility level (tier 1), primary health care staff notified the malaria control programme, which then confirmed adequate stocks of malaria treatment to manage potential increased cases. The cases were followed up at household level to verify the likely source of infection. The binomial thresholds were reviewed at village/town level (tier 2) to determine whether additional response measures were required. In addition, an automated electronic outbreak identification system at town/village level (tier 2) was integrated into the case notification database (tier 3) to ensure that unexpected increases in case notification were not missed. The performance of these binomial outbreak thresholds was evaluated against other currently recommended thresholds using retrospective data. The acceptability of the system at primary health care level was evaluated through structured interviews with health facility staff., RESULTS: Eighty four percent of health facilities reported outbreaks within 24 hours (n = 95), 92\% (n = 104) within 48 hours and 100\% (n = 113) within 72 hours. Appropriate response to all malaria outbreaks (n = 113, tier 1, n = 46, tier 2) were achieved within 24 hours. The system was positively viewed by all health facility staff. When compared to other epidemiological systems for a specified 12 month outbreak season (June 2003 to July 2004) the binomial exact thresholds produced one false weekly outbreak, the C-sum 12 weekly outbreaks and the mean + 2 SD nine false weekly outbreaks. Exceeding the binomial level 1 threshold triggered an alert four weeks prior to an outbreak, but exceeding the binomial level 2 threshold identified an outbreak as it occurred., CONCLUSION: The malaria outbreak surveillance system using binomial thresholds achieved its primary goal of identifying outbreaks early facilitating appropriate local public health responses aimed at averting a possible large-scale epidemic in a low, and unstable, malaria transmission setting.}

  abstract = {Background: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has been widely recognized as a major public health issue, which can be addressed through effective AMR surveillance systems. In 2018, a national surveillance programme for AMR in the community and nursing homes called Mission PRIMO was established in France. It builds on an existing network called MedQual-Ville that had been monitoring AMR mainly in the west of France community since 2003., Objectives and Methods: To evaluate the MedQual-Ville surveillance activities and to formulate practical recommendations for improvement, using a semi-quantitative evaluation framework called OASIS., Results: The evaluation showed that MedQual-Ville is overall a well-performing surveillance system. Its major strengths rely on excellent coordination and internal communication with clinical laboratories that participate on a voluntary basis. Surveillance objectives and procedures are clear to all participants. Hence, the quality and reliability of the data being produced is very high. At this stage, the major area for improvement is representativeness, with poor coverage achieved in several densely populated areas. Besides, the utility and impact of surveillance data could be improved by strengthening communication towards end-users, especially local prescribers., Conclusions: There is currently no European programme or guidance for AMR surveillance in the community and nursing homes. Our results partly fill this gap, by evaluating how surveillance is being performed in France and providing recommendations that could be applicable to other countries with similar health systems. This work also highlighted the relevance of OASIS for evaluation of surveillance systems in the human sector. Copyright {\copyright} The Author(s) 2022.

The conflict in Syria has left many children unvaccinated and movement from areas with polio cases to Europe calls for increased awareness to detect and respond to virus-transmission in a timely manner. We evaluate the national EV laboratory surveillance, to generate recommendations for system strengthening. The system was analysed for completeness of viral typing analysis and clinical information and timeliness of specimen collection, laboratory results and reporting of clinical information. Of 23,720 specimens screened, 2,202 (9.3\%) were EV-positive. Submission of cerebrospinal fluid and faecal specimens from primary diagnostic laboratories was 79.5\% complete (845/1,063), and varied by laboratory and patient age. EV genotypes were determined in 68.5\% (979/1,430) of laboratory-confirmed cases, clinical information was available for 63.1\% (903/1,430). Primary diagnostic results were available after a median of 1.4 days, typing results after 17 days, detailed clinical information after 33 days. The large number of samples typed demonstrated continued monitoring of EV-circulation in Denmark. The system could be strengthened by increasing the collection of supplementary faecal specimens, improving communication with primary diagnostic laboratories, adapting the laboratory typing methodology and collecting clinical information with electronic forms.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: An adverse event following immunisation is any untoward medical occurrence which follows vaccination. Frequency of adverse events ranges from 13\% to 34\% and they should be reported regardless of severity. From the beginning of 2016 to mid-2017, Guruve district in Zimbabwe did not report any AEFIs. This suggests the surveillance system may be failing to detect adverse events. We therefore evaluated the AEFI surveillance system in Guruve district., METHODS: We conducted a surveillance system evaluation using the updated Centers for Disease Control guidelines for evaluating public health surveillance systems. We interviewed health workers and caregivers of babies under 2 years in Guruve district. We also reviewed all records on AEFI surveillance for the period of January 2016 to November 2017., RESULTS: We recruited 31 health workers and 33 caregivers into the study. Between January 2016 and mid-2017, 39\% of the caregivers had children who had suffered AEFIs and 45\% of the health workers had encountered AEFIs but none had been notified. The main reasons for failure to report AEFIs included health workers' fear of personal consequences and caregivers thinking that an adverse event was not serious enough to report. Knowledge of the surveillance system was good amongst the majority of health workers. All the resources needed by the surveillance system were available., CONCLUSION: We concluded that health workers in Guruve district were afraid to report adverse events following immunization and caregivers were reluctant to report mild adverse events hence the surveillance system was performing poorly and was not useful. However, the stability of the system and the good knowledge gives a good foundation for improving the surveillance system.},

Since then, models have been developed and complex systems have evolved with a breadth of disparate data to detect or forecast chemical, biological, and radiological events that have a significant impact on the One Health landscape. How the attributes identified in 2001 relate to the new range of event-based biosurveillance technologies is unclear. This article frames the continuum of event-based biosurveillance systems (that fuse media reports from the internet), models (ie, computational that forecast disease occurrence), and constructs (ie, descriptive analytical reports) through an operational lens (ie, aspects and attributes associated with operational considerations in the development, testing, and validation of the event-based biosurveillance methods and models and their use in an operational environment). A workshop was held in 2010 to scientifically identify, develop, and vet a set of attributes for event-based biosurveillance. Subject matter experts were invited from 7 federal government agencies and 6 different academic institutions pursuing research in biosurveillance event detection. We describe 8 attribute families for the characterization of event-based biosurveillance: event, readiness, operational aspects, geographic coverage, population coverage, input data, output, and cost. Ultimately, the analyses provide a framework from which the broad scope, complexity, and relevant issues germane to event-based biosurveillance useful in an operational environment can be characterized.},

  abstract = {Background: The Health in Prisons European Database (HIPED) aims to periodically collect data on prison health systems, services and health outcomes to inform equivalence of care for people living in prison. Recognized as the United Nations hub for health data in prisons, HIPED lacked an established framework to define its domains and indicators to measure progress. Therefore, the objectives of developing this framework were to inform surveillance systems at prison, local, regional, national and international level and to use it to guide improvement of prison health systems and cross-country comparison. Methods: The framework was conceptualized through identification of policy priorities and existing frameworks, notably the WHO Health System Framework. A consultation with a range of WHO stakeholders was conducted evaluating the components of existing frameworks and their relevance to the prison health context, as well as identifying areas needing further emphasis. The final stage identified the structure of the framework. Results: The framework consists of three main building blocks. The first captures the system-level aspects of prison health care (or inputs) whilst the second captures delivery aspects of prison health care (or outputs). These building blocks are in turn modified by two influencing factors. Ultimately, all these elements impact on the third building block, health outcomes. In addition, two cross-cutting principles associated with all these building blocks and influencing factors are included. Conclusions: A new framework for assessing prison health system performance is now available, crucial to support informed decision-making for policy design and implementation for prisons and other places of detention.},

  abstract = {This article aimed to evaluate the performance of Health Surveillance in Pernambuco in the year of 2012. An evaluative research based on the multidimensional model for comprehensive and global evaluation of health systems performance was conducted. The logic model of state health surveillance, adapted to the multidimensional evaluation model, and conceived as a judgement and analysis matrix was created. Primary data, collected through interviews with key informants, and secondary data, from health surveillance information systems and official documents, were used. The performance of health surveillance in Pernambuco was satisfactory (64.0\%). The value ``maintenance function'' scored excellent (85.0\%) followed by ``adaptation'' (70.0\%) and ``production'' (60.0\%) functions, both with satisfactory performance. The ``achieving goals'' function scored unsatisfactory (41.0\%), due, in part, to the set of weaknesses found in the other functions. The performance evaluation of the state health surveillance, using the integral model, turned out to be an appropriate strategy to the identification of strengths and weaknesses in various performance dimensions, providing the means to better understand it and to establish improvement strategies. {\copyright} 2015, Institute de Medicina Social da UERJ.

Effective community-based systems to detect P. falciparum cases remaining positive 72 hours after initiating treatment would be valuable for guiding case follow-up in areas of known resistance risk and for detecting areas of emerging resistance., METHODS: Systems incorporating existing networks of village malaria workers (VMWs) to monitor day three-positive P. falciparum cases were piloted in three provinces in western Cambodia. Quantitative and qualitative data were used to evaluate the wider feasibility and sustainability of community-based surveillance of day three-positive P. falciparum cases., RESULTS: Of 294 day-3 blood slides obtained across all sites (from 297 day-0 positives), 63 were positive for P. falciparum, an overall day-3 positivity rate of 21\%. There were significant variations in the systems implemented by different partners. Full engagement of VMWs and health centre staff is critical. VMWs are responsible for a range of individual tasks including preparing blood slides on day-0, completing forms, administering directly observed therapy (DOT) on days 0-2, obtaining follow-up slides on day-3 and transporting slides and paperwork to their supervising health centre. When suitably motivated, unsalaried VMWs are willing and able to produce good quality blood smears and achieve very high rates of DOT and day-3 follow-up., CONCLUSIONS: Community-based surveillance of day-3 P. falciparum cases is feasible, but highly intensive, and as such needs strong and continuous support, particularly supervision and training. The purpose and role of community-based day-3 surveillance should be assessed in the light of resource requirements; scaling-up would need to be systematic and targeted, based on clearly defined epidemiological criteria. To be truly comprehensive, the system would need to be extended beyond VMWs to other public and private health providers.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Solomon Islands is one of the least developed countries in the world. Recognising that timely detection of outbreaks is needed to enable early and effective response to disease outbreaks, the Solomon Islands government introduced a simple syndromic surveillance system in 2011. We conducted the first evaluation of the system and the first exploration of a national experience within the broader multi-country Pacific Syndromic Surveillance System to determine if it is meeting its objectives and to identify opportunities for improvement., METHODS: We used a multi-method approach involving retrospective data collection and statistical analysis, modelling, qualitative research and observational methods., RESULTS: We found that the system was well accepted, highly relied upon and designed to account for contextual limitations. We found the syndromic algorithm used to identify outbreaks was moderately sensitive, detecting 11.8\% (IQR: 6.3-25.0\%), 21.3\% (IQR: 10.3-36.8\%), 27.5\% (IQR: 12.8-52.3\%) and 40.5\% (IQR: 13.5-65.7\%) of outbreaks that caused small, moderate, large and very large increases in case presentations to health facilities, respectively. The false alert rate was 10.8\% (IQR: 4.8-24.5\%). Rural coverage of the system was poor. Limited workforce, surveillance resourcing and other 'upstream' health system factors constrained performance., CONCLUSIONS: The system has made a significant contribution to public health security in Solomon Islands, but remains insufficiently sensitive to detect small-moderate sized outbreaks and hence should not be relied upon as a stand-alone surveillance strategy. Rather, the system should sit within a complementary suite of early warning surveillance activities including event-based, in-patient- and laboratory-based surveillance methods. Future investments need to find a balance between actions to address the technical and systems issues that constrain performance while maintaining simplicity and hence sustainability.},

This evaluation aims to assess whether the PSSS is meeting its objectives, what progress has been made since a formative evaluation of the system was conducted in 2011, and provides recommendations to enhance the PSSS's performance in the future., METHODS: Twenty-one informant interviews were conducted with national operators of the system and regional public health agencies that use information generated by it. Historic PSSS data were analysed to assess timeliness and completeness of reporting., RESULTS: The system is simple, acceptable and useful for public health decision-makers. The PSSS has greatly enhanced Pacific island countries' ability to undertake early warning surveillance and has contributed to efforts to meet national surveillance-related International Health Regulation (2005) capacity development obligations. Despite this, issues with timeliness and completeness of reporting, data quality and system stability persist., CONCLUSION: A balance between maintaining the system's simplicity and technical advances will need to be found to ensure its long-term sustainability, given the low-resource context for which it is designed.

  abstract = {Surveillance systems for rabies in endemic regions are often subject to severe constraints in terms of resources. The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the World Health Organisation (WHO) propose the use of an active surveillance system to substantiate claims of disease freedom, including rabies. However, many countries do not have the resources to establish active surveillance systems for rabies and the testing of dead dogs poses logistical challenges. This paper explores the potential of using a scenario tree model parameterised with data collected via questionnaires and interviews to estimate the sensitivity of passive surveillance, assessing its potential as a viable low-cost alternative to active surveillance systems. The results of this explorative study illustrated that given a large enough sample size, in this case the entire population of Colombo City, the sensitivity of passive surveillance can be 100\% even at a low disease prevalence (0.1\%), despite the low sensitivity of individual surveillance components (mean values in the range 4.077x10(-5)-1.834x10(-3) at 1\% prevalence). In addition, logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with increased recognition of rabies in dogs and reporting of rabies suspect dogs. Increased recognition was observed amongst dog owners (OR 3.8 (CI, 1.3-10.8)), people previously bitten by dogs (OR 5.9 (CI, 2.2-15.9)) and people who believed they had seen suspect dogs in the past (OR 4.7 (CI, 1.8-12.9)). Increased likelihood of reporting suspect dogs was observed amongst dog owners (OR 5.3 (CI, 1.1-25)). Further work is required to validate the data collection tool and the assumptions made in the model with respect to sample size in order to develop a robust methodology for evaluating passive rabies surveillance.

Five hundred and three patients were selected according to new surveillance guidelines in one part of the Danish-Bangladesh Leprosy Mission leprosy control project working area. Surveillance coverage of 71\% was achieved in a 7-month period. During this time, 10 released-from-treatment (RFT) patients from among the study group were found to have acute nerve damage requiring prednisolone treatment. Out of the 10, only 2 were detected actively; the remaining 8 self-reported. It is concluded that health education given at RFT time is effective in motivating patients to self-report with acute nerve damage, and that the time spent on active surveillance could have been better used in other activities, i.e., case detection. As a result of these findings, active surveillance has been abandoned in the leprosy control project.}

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Social media networks have transformed the sources of information, including health information. In particular, the microblogging service Twitter has been used as a learning tool in the field of medicine as well as a tool for disease surveillance and outbreak management. As antimicrobial resistance is one of the biggest concerns of public health, we aimed to review how Twitter is being used as a tool for antimicrobial stewardship (AMS)., METHODS: We used the software Kampal Social R to collect, analyze and monitor tweets from the whole Twitter network to assess the activity that takes place about antibiotics. The study was carried out in three phases: data acquisition, during which we collected data over a six-month period (from 21 September 2016 to 8 February 2017) by monitoring selected users, hashtags and keywords that we knew to be related to AMS; data cleansing, which involved identifying users who were not related to the topic, thus creating a new collection process to remove those users and add newly discovered ones; and, finally, data acquisition and analysis (From 1 April 2017 to 7 March 2018), during which we collected data using the new users obtained in the cleansing phase. We qualitatively characterized the most influential users, we analysed the use of hashtags and the flow of information (the most retweeted users and the global network formed by all the users)., RESULTS: Using the tool Kampal Social R, and after a cleansing phase to remove irrelevant information, we worked with a dataset of 1,765,388 tweets. Studying the qualitative characterization of the top-ten influencers, we found that most of them are institutional users, but individual users, such as physicians, and an important medical journal also appeared. Regarding hashtags, '\#antibiotics' was the one with the most occurrences. Hashtags follow a regular distribution over time, with some defined peaks connected to important dates and reports about antibiotics. As for the flow of information, we obtained a rather dense network of interconnections formed by all the users who had sent a message, which means that a strong relation exists between the different organizations, professionals and users in general., CONCLUSIONS: Institutions, medical journals, physicians and pharmacists are key opinion leaders in the topic of antibiotics, so they must incorporate social media into their communication strategy to spread the AMS message. More evidence is needed regarding the optimal method of communication to spread information throughout the general population. The development of tools capable of collecting and querying large amounts of Twitter data helped us to assess the impact of antibiotic awareness campaigns and to gain an idea of how Twitter is being used to spread the message about AMS.

The aim of this study was to assess the quality of Barrett's surveillance in daily practice in The Netherlands. Material(s) and Method(s): A structured scoring list was developed to evaluate systematically the quality of endoscopy and pathology reports. From 15 hospitals, endoscopy reports and corresponding pathology reports were selected randomly and evaluated by two observers. In case of disagreement, the observers re-evaluated the reports in a consensus meeting. Result(s): One hundred and fifty cases were evaluated. The adherence to current standard biopsy protocols (four quadrant biopsies every 2cm) decreased with increasing Barrett's length: 0-5 cm: 79\%; 5-10cm: 50\%; 10-15cm: 30\%. The indication for the endoscopy was mentioned in 28\% of the pathology reports, in 4\% the presence/absence of oesophagitis was communicated, and in 19\% the location and/or aetiology of biopsies was described. The presence/absence of dysplasia was mentioned in 93\% of pathology reports. Conclusion(s): Endoscopy reports and pathology reports in current practice do not include all relevant information for an adequate Barrett's surveillance. In short Barrett's oesophagus, the adherence to current standard biopsy protocols is acceptable, but in longer segments (with a higher risk for neoplastic progression) this is clearly insufficient. The communication between endoscopists and pathologist is suboptimal. {\copyright} 2008 Wolters Kluwer Health / Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.}

The surveillance of vaccine-preventable diseases has evolved as programmes mature, to monitor progress towards disease control targets. The establishment of goals to reduce measles cases by 90\%, eliminate neonatal tetanus, and eradicate poliomyelitis has put increased emphasis on the need for effective disease surveillance.

The objectives of the study were to describe and evaluate the epidemiological surveillance of prion diseases in the State of Sao Paulo and to epidemiologically describe the cases of Creutzfeldt Jakob disease (CJD) from 2012 to 2016. Methods \& Materials: The data source used was the division of foodborne and waterborne diseases database. The methodology used was proposed by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2001, Updated Guidelines for Evaluating Public Health Surveillance Systems and the qualitative, quantitative and utility attributes of the system were evaluated, for the descriptive study were measured frequency and central tendency. The data were analyzed in Epi Info. Result(s): In the evaluation of the surveillance system, the same was inflexible with regard to the insertion of the notification form in the SINAN (Information System of Notifiable Diseases). The information system does not have duplications, generally with good completeness. It is noteworthy that the field of evolution, of great importance for the closure of the case, presented low completeness. The system was classified as sensitive and useful. Were classified 80 cases of CJD. The median age was 63 years and female represented 55\% of the cases. All have progressive dementia, the most signs and symptoms were myoclonus (72.5\%) and psychiatric disorders (57.5\%). Of the nonspecific exams, 65.7\% of patients with normal MRI with 37.1\% of typical EEGs and 76.7\% with 14.3.3 protein present. In 68\% of the cases that performed the genetic analysis, the mutation was more frequent in the E200K codon. According to the final diagnosis, 74 (92.5\%) cases were classified for sporadic CJD with evolution of 126 days for died and six (7.5\%) as familial CJD, with a history of around 261 days. Conclusion(s): The elaboration and insertion of a notification sheet of prion diseases in the SINAN, with clinical, laboratory and epidemiological data for the classification of the forms of the disease and follow-up of its evolution.

With regard to data completeness, SISAGUA obtained an excellent classification for 25 variables, good for two, regular for three, poor for one and very poor for four variables. Conclusion: The system showed excellent data completeness for most of the variables. This type of study contributes to the continuous impro-vement of SISAGUA and enables the identification of inconsistencies and weaknesses. {\copyright} 2022, Ministry of Health.

  abstract = {Interprofessional collaboration is a key factor in initiatives designed to increase the effectiveness of health services currently offered to the public. It is important that the concept of collaboration be well understood, because although the increasingly complex health problems faced by health professionals are creating more interdependencies among them, we still have limited knowledge of the complexity of interprofessional relationships. The goal of this literature review was to identify conceptual frameworks that could improve our understanding of this important aspect of health organizations. To this end, we have identified and taken into consideration: (A) the various definitions proposed in the literature and the various concepts associated with collaboration, and (B) the various theoretical frameworks of collaboration. Our results demonstrate that: (1) the concept of collaboration is commonly defined through five underlying concepts: sharing, partnership, power, interdependency and process; (2) the most complete models of collaboration seem to be those based on a strong theoretical background, either in organizational theory or in organizational sociology and on empirical data; (3) there is a significant amount of diversity in the way the various authors conceptualized collaboration and in the factors influencing collaboration; (4) these frameworks do not establish clear links between the elements in the models and the outputs; and (5) the literature does not provide a serious attempt to determine how patients could be integrated into the health care team, despite the fact that patients are recognized as the ultimate justification for providing collaborative care.},

Reaching a live person upon dialing, regardless of who that person was, was the strongest predictor of optimal performance both in being connected with an action officer and in consistency of connection times., CONCLUSIONS: Health departments can achieve optimal performance in consistently connecting a caller with an action officer in 30 minutes or less and may improve performance by using a telephone-based disease surveillance system in which the phone is answered by a live person at all times.},

The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Wildlife Services National Rabies Management Program has implemented enhanced rabies surveillance (ERS) to improve case detection across the extent of the raccoon oral rabies vaccination (ORV) management area. We evaluated ERS and public health surveillance data from 2006 to 2017 in three northeastern USA states using a dynamic occupancy modeling approach. Our objectives were to examine potential risk corridors for RABV incursion from the U.S. into Canada, evaluate the effectiveness of ORV management strategies, and identify surveillance gaps. ORV management has resulted in a decrease in RABV cases over time within vaccination zones (from occupancy ( psi  ) of 0.60 standard error (SE) = 0.03 in the spring of 2006 to psi  of 0.33 SE = 0.10 in the spring 2017). RABV cases also reduced in the enzootic area (from psi  of 0.60 SE = 0.03 in the spring of 2006 to psi  of 0.45 SE = 0.05 in the spring 2017). Although RABV occurrence was related to habitat type, greater impacts were associated with ORV and trap-vaccinate-release (TVR) campaigns, in addition to seasonal and yearly trends. Reductions in RABV occupancy were more pronounced in areas treated with Ontario Rabies Vaccine Bait (ONRAB) compared to RABORAL V-RG R. Our approach tracked changes in RABV occurrence across space and time, identified risk corridors for potential incursions into Canada, and highlighted surveillance gaps, while evaluating the impacts of management actions. Using this approach, we are able to provide guidance for future RABV management.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In New South Wales (NSW), influenza surveillance is informed by a number of discrete data sources, including laboratories, emergency departments, death registrations and community surveillance programs. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the NSW influenza surveillance system using the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for evaluating public health surveillance systems. Importance of study: Having a strong influenza surveillance system is important for both seasonal and pandemic influenza preparedness. The findings will inform recommendations for strengthening surveillance in NSW., METHODS: The scope was limited to all sources included in the NSW Health Influenza Report in 2012-13. To assess the performance of the system, in-depth interviews (N = 21) were conducted with key stakeholders and thematically analysed. Respiratory testing data gathered through the sentinel laboratories in 2012 were used to estimate sensitivity, and laboratory notifications were analysed to assess timeliness and representativeness. Key documents - including reports, guidelines, correspondence and meeting minutes - were also reviewed, providing a method of triangulation., RESULTS: The NSW influenza surveillance system integrates multiple sources of surveillance of influenza and influenza-like illness to provide a comprehensive picture of influenza in the community. Despite its structural complexity, the system delivers quality, timely and relevant data to inform a range of public health activities, and the NSW Health Influenza Report is well regarded by stakeholders. Challenges include managing system complexity, key person risk and cross-jurisdictional issues. Stakeholders commented that system flexibility would depend on additional resourcing. Although the sensitivity of sentinel laboratory surveillance was estimated as 1-25\%, depending on the time of year, understanding sensitivity remains a challenge in influenza surveillance where the true incidence of infection is unknown., CONCLUSION: Influenza surveillance is critical for monitoring virological changes, understanding disease epidemiology and informing public health responses. The system was found to deliver timely and good-quality surveillance information. Additional value could be achieved by increasing flexibility and stability, automating systems (where possible) and formalising processes of data acquisition. The system continues to negotiate a number of constraints, including complexity and cross-jurisdictional issues, which are ongoing obstacles to realising some potential system improvements.},

  abstract = {This study aimed to assess the performance of health surveillance regionalization with different levels of development in Brazil. A cross-sectional quantitative approach was used with data collected through a structured questionnaire, prepared on the basis of three study dimensions (Policy, Structure, and Organization), applied to 31 key actors in health surveillance in the selected Health Regions and municipalities. The measure of central tendency was mean score, and synthetic indices were obtained for each dimension and attribute. Three cutoff points were assigned to assess performance: values less than or equal to 4.99 were considered unsatisfactory; from 5.00 to 6.99, intermediate; and greater than or equal to 7.00, satisfactory. The study found that regionalization performance in health surveillance was only satisfactory in one region, intermediate in four, and unsatisfactory in one. Among the three dimensions, Policy and Organization showed the best performance and Structure showed the worst. In conclusion, in general, the higher the level of socioeconomic development and services supply, the better the performance in regionalization of health surveillance. The evaluation portrays the complexity of contexts in different regions of Brazil, thus contributing to understanding the dynamics of health surveillance regionalization in Brazil. {\copyright} 2019 Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz.

In France, a new nationwide surveillance system for influenza-like illness, GrippeNet.fr, was introduced since the 2011/2012 season based on an online participatory mechanism and open to the general population. We evaluate the recruitment and participation of users to the first pilot season with respect to similar efforts in Europe to assess the feasibility of establishing a participative network of surveillance in France. We further investigate the representativeness of the GrippeNet.fr population along a set of indicators on geographical, demographic, socio-economic and health aspects. Participation was widespread in the country and with rates comparable to other European countries with partnered projects running since a longer time. It was not representative of the general population in terms of age and gender, however all age classes were represented, including the older classes (65+ years old), generally less familiar with the digital world, but considered at high risk for influenza complications. Once adjusted on demographic indicators, the GrippeNet.fr population is found to be more frequently employed, with a higher education level and vaccination rate with respect to the general population. A similar propensity to commute for work to different regions was observed, and no significant difference was found for asthma and diabetes. Results show the feasibility of the system, provide indications to inform adjusted epidemic analyses, and highlight the presence of specific population groups that need to be addressed by targeted communication strategies to achieve a higher representativeness in the following seasons.}

  abstract = {Introduction: India's Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) in North 24 Parganas District of West Bengal reported outbreaks of acute diarrhoeal diseases (ADD) during 2010-2014 without laboratory confirmation. Hence, we described the surveillance system and evaluated in terms of selected surveillance attributes: simplicity, acceptability, timeliness of reporting of ADD/outbreaks, representativeness, positive predictive value, usefulness. Method(s): We described the surveillance through review of documents, manuals, records and interview of surveillance staff. For evaluation of the surveillance system, cross sectional study was conducted among 95 sampled Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs), 22 Block Medical Officers (BMOHs) of the District and also abstracted data from records. We developed indicators for surveillance attributes and computed proportions for the same. We computed descriptive statistics for timeliness of reporting. Result(s): Seventeen percent (n = 15) of first ANMs and six of nineteen medical officers had correct knowledge on ADD case definition. One-fourth of the ANMs reported lack of communication, training, supervision and lack of feedback in preceding six months. Median time taken to intimate district rapid response team (RRT) and to collect specimen from the date of first case reporting was the same day of reporting of index case (Range: 0-2 days vs. 0-3 days) during ADD outbreaks in 2014. Of the five reported ADD outbreaks in 2014, one was laboratory confirmed. Conclusion(s): Knowledge regarding case definition was poor at all level of health workers. Existing supervision and feedback mechanism needs to be improved. Timeliness of reporting to district RRT and specimen collection during outbreak had improved overtime.Copyright {\copyright} 2017},

  abstract = {Objective As more electronic health records have become available during the last decade, we aimed to uncover recent trends in use of electronically available patient data by electronic surveillance systems for healthcare associated infections (HAIs) and identify consequences for system effectiveness. Methods A systematic review of published literature evaluating electronic HAI surveillance systems was performed. The PubMed service was used to retrieve publications between January 2001 and December 2011. Studies were included in the review if they accurately described what electronic data were used and if system effectiveness was evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, or negative predictive value. Trends were identified by analyzing changes in the number and types of electronic data sources used. Results 26 publications comprising discussions on 27 electronic systems met the eligibility criteria. Trend analysis showed that systems use an increasing number of data sources which are either medico-administrative or clinical and laboratory-based data. Trends on the use of individual types of electronic data confirmed the paramount role of microbiology data in HAI detection, but also showed increased use of biochemistry and pharmacy data, and the limited adoption of clinical data and physician narratives. System effectiveness assessments indicate that the use of heterogeneous data sources results in higher system sensitivity at the expense of specificity. Conclusions Driven by the increased availability of electronic patient data, electronic HAI surveillance systems use more data, making systems more sensitive yet less specific, but also allow systems to be tailored to the needs of healthcare institutes' surveillance programs.},

Methods: eleven municipalities were selected in the State of Pernambuco, Brazil, based on the geographical, demographic and management criteria. The level of implementation was estimated by way of interviews with key-players at three levels of ES: the headquarters, family health units (FHUs) and traditional health units (THUs), laying emphasis on features relating to infrastructure and the work process. Points were assigned for the selected variables, which, taken as a whole, allowed for classification of ES as: fully introduced, partially introduced, or not introduced. In order to evaluate management, the eleven municipal health secretaries were interviewed. Results: ES was found to have been fully introduced in only 27\% of municipalities and partially introduced in 45\%, having a better structure in larger-scale municipalities where there is full management of the municipal system. In these, of the three levels studied, it was found that the central level showed the greatest weaknesses, and that the FHUs performed better than the THUs. So far as management is concerned, although all the municipalities were certified to carry out ES activities, it was found that there are significant obstacles to its effective introduction. Conclusions: ES still has shortcomings that hamper its full introduction at municipal level.},

Methods identifying and quantifying costs and benefits incurred by public and private actors of passive surveillance systems (i.e. actors of veterinary authorities and private actors who may report clinical signs) are needed. This study presents the evaluation of perceived costs and benefits of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) passive surveillance in Vietnam. Surveys based on participatory epidemiology methods were conducted in three provinces in Vietnam to collect data on costs and benefits resulting from the reporting of HPAI suspicions to veterinary authorities. A quantitative tool based on stated preference methods and participatory techniques was developed and applied to assess the non-monetary costs and benefits. The study showed that poultry farmers are facing several options regarding the management of HPAI suspicions, besides reporting the following: treatment, sale or destruction of animals. The option of reporting was associated with uncertain outcome and transaction costs. Besides, actors anticipated the release of health information to cause a drop of markets prices. This cost was relevant at all levels, including farmers, veterinary authorities and private actors of the upstream sector (feed, chicks and medicine supply). One benefit associated with passive surveillance was the intervention of public services to clean farms and the environment to limit the disease spread. Private actors of the poultry sector valued information on HPAI suspicions (perceived as a non-monetary benefit) which was mainly obtained from other private actors and media.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: During the 2009 influenza pandemic period, routine surveillance of influenza-like-illness (ILI) was conducted in The Netherlands by a network of sentinel general practitioners (GPs). In addition during the pandemic period, four other ILI/influenza surveillance systems existed. For pandemic preparedness, we evaluated the performance of the sentinel system and the others to assess which of the four could be useful additions in the future. We also assessed whether performance of the five systems was influenced by media reports during the pandemic period., METHODS: The trends in ILI consultation rates reported by sentinel GPs from 20 April 2009 through 3 January 2010 were compared with trends in data from the other systems: ILI cases self-reported through the web-based Great Influenza Survey (GIS); influenza-related web searches through Google Flu Trends (GFT); patients admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed pandemic influenza, and detections of influenza virus by laboratories. In addition, correlations were determined between ILI consultation rates of the sentinel GPs and data from the four other systems. We also compared the trends of the five surveillance systems with trends in pandemic-related newspaper and television coverage and determined correlation coefficients with and without time lags., RESULTS: The four other systems showed similar trends and had strong correlations with the ILI consultation rates reported by sentinel GPs. The number of influenza virus detections was the only system to register a summer peak. Increases in the number of newspaper articles and television broadcasts did not precede increases in activity among the five surveillance systems., CONCLUSIONS: The sentinel general practice network should remain the basis of influenza surveillance, as it integrates epidemiological and virological information and was able to maintain stability and continuity under pandemic pressure. Hospital and virological data are important during a pandemic, tracking the severity, molecular and phenotypic characterization of the viruses and confirming whether ILI incidence is truly related to influenza virus infections. GIS showed that web-based, self-reported ILI can be a useful addition, especially if virological self-sampling is added and an epidemic threshold could be determined. GFT showed negligible added value.}

Elsewhere, syndromic surveillance has already shown that professional data can be used for public health (PH) surveillance but not during a long-term follow-up of the same cohort., OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to build and assess a national ecological NH PH surveillance system (SS)., METHODS: Using a national network of 126 NH, we built a residents' cohort, extracted medical and personal data from their electronic health records, and transmitted them through the internet to a national server almost in real time. After recording sociodemographic, autonomic and syndromic information, a set of 26 syndromes was defined using pattern matching with the standard query language-LIKE operator and a Delphi-like technique, between November 2010 and June 2016. We used early aberration reporting system (EARS) and Bayes surveillance algorithms of the R surveillance package (Hohle) to assess our influenza and acute gastroenteritis (AGE) syndromic data against the Sentinelles network data, French epidemics gold standard, following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveillance system assessment guidelines., RESULTS: By extracting all sociodemographic residents' data, a cohort of 41,061 senior citizens was built. EARS\_C3 algorithm on NH influenza and AGE syndromic data gave sensitivities of 0.482 and 0.539 and specificities of 0.844 and 0.952, respectively, over a 6-year period, forecasting the last influenza outbreak by catching early flu signals. In addition, assessment of influenza and AGE syndromic data quality showed precisions of 0.98 and 0.96 during last season epidemic weeks' peaks (weeks 03-2017 and 01-2017) and precisions of 0.95 and 0.92 during last summer epidemic weeks' low (week 33-2016)., CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed that using syndromic information gives a good opportunity to develop a genuine French national PH SS dedicated to senior citizens. Access to senior citizens' free-text validated health data on influenza and AGE responds to a PH issue for the surveillance of this fragile population. This database will also make possible new ecological research on other subjects that will improve prevention, care, and rapid response when facing health threats.

  abstract = {Disease surveillance generates evidence for decision making. Surveillance evaluation focuses on measuring the value of surveillance efforts to take meaningful actions and to inform policy decisions. This value will depend on how well aligned the surveillance efforts are with the fundamental policy question, and on the quality of the surveillance evidence (see Part II). The former relates to strategic relevance, the latter to operational performance. This chapter attempts to explore how evaluation could help improving the strategic relevance of animal health surveillance but also the barriers to the uptake of evaluation recommendations by policy makers, regardless of the surveillance performance itself. {\copyright} Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

Since then the collaboration has been consolidated and presently also several laboratories are part of the network named MediLabSecure, on the basis of the European project started in 2014 that aimed at enhancing surveillance and control of arbovirus infections. In four years of the MediLabSecure (2014-2017), the studies and the implemented activities provided relevant results and lessons learned reported and discussed in this strategic document. The main objective is to contribute to the strategies for the prevention and control of arbovirus infections with a One Health approach, by focusing on integrated surveillance and multisectoral risk assessments. We propose a conceptual framework to facilitate the description, comparison and assessment of integrated surveillance systems and we provide recommendations to enhance operationalization of One Health strategies in national health policies and regional contexts.},

  abstract = {Using a risk-based approach, the SAGIR network (dedicated to wildlife disease surveillance) had to strengthen surveillance activities after ASF was confirmed in Belgium in September 2018, very near the French border. Three new active dead wild boars search protocols supplemented opportunistic surveillance in Level III risk areas: patrols by volunteer hunters, professional systematic combing, and dog detection. Those protocols were targeted in terms of location and time and complemented each other. The main objectives of the designed surveillance system were (i) to assure early detection in case of introduction of the disease and (ii) to support the free status of the zone. Compiling the surveillance effort was thus a necessity to assure authorities and producer representatives that the sometimes low number of carcasses detected was not a consequence of no surveillance activities. The human involvement in implementing those activities was significant: more than 1000 8-h days just for the time spent in the field on active search activities. We calculated a specific indicator to enable a comparison of the surveillance results from different zones, including non-infected Belgian zones with strengthened surveillance activities. This was a first step in the evaluation of the efficacy of our surveillance activities in a WB population. Field experiments and modelling dead WB detection probability are planned to supplement this evaluation. Belgium regained its ASF-free status in November 2020, and ASF was not detected in France in either the WB or domestic pig populations.},

We evaluated the implementation of NHBS among Denver men who have sex with men (MSM), considering the system's simplicity, data quality, representativeness, and sensitivity to trends. We found that the time required for implementation and the complexity of data management and analysis are barriers to disseminating local findings. Data quality has improved in each cycle of the study but must be protected by continually checking for errors and training field staff to be attentive to detail. Compared with the US census and other convenience samples of Denver MSM, the overall demographic representativeness of NHBS has improved over time. However, there is concern that the underlying population included in the study may be changing. NHBS survey data show evidence of two suspected trends in the local MSM population at risk for HIV: increasing sexual risk-taking and the transition away from bars as a dominant partner-finding location. It is unclear whether the increasing reports of sexual risk-taking reflect a real trend or simply a change in the population sampled, since most NHBS participants are recruited at gay bars and other venues. To ensure that the sample continues to represent the underlying population at risk and accurately identify trends, it is necessary to closely monitor MSM sample characteristics during implementation and incorporate weighted data provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention into analyses.}

  abstract = {Background: Nigeria is one of the three countries where transmission of Wild Polio Virus (WPV) still occurs. Documented transmission occurs mainly in the northern part of the country. Acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance is one of polio eradication and endgame strategic plan. On this basis, we evaluated the AFP surveillance system in Bayelsa state, Nigeria with the aim of assessing the attributes of the system. Methods \& Materials: We interviewed Stakeholders and reviewed AFP surveillance data from 2013 to 2017 using the updated CDC guidelines for evaluating the public health surveillance systems and the WHO performance standards to assess the performance of the system. Relevant data were extracted and analyzed using Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. Result(s): All 27 respondents knew that poliomyelitis was caused by a virus and they all felt that AFP case definition was easy to understand. 73\% percent of them reported that completion of the Case Investigation Form (CIF) was simple. All the respondents were willing to continue to participate in the AFP surveillance. The non-polio AFP rate (12.3-16.6\%) and stool specimen adequacy rate (98-100\%) indicate high sensitivity. Proportion of AFP cases investigated within 48 h of notification, timely transportation, specimen arriving laboratory in good condition were all above WHO minimum standard of 80\%. The surveillance system has dedicated staff from state ministry of health and support from National Stop Transmission of Polio (NSTOP). Conclusion(s): The AFP surveillance system in Bayelsa State is performing well. The system is useful, simple, flexible, acceptable, sensitive, representative, timely and stable. We recommended that regular training of data collectors should be implemented.Copyright {\copyright} 2020},

  abstract = {Background: In the fall of 2014, in response to outbreaks of an emerging respiratory pathogen enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) which affected mostly children, a rapid time-limited surveillance pilot for hospitalized cases was conducted in seven Canadian jurisdictions. Objective: To evaluate whether the goals of the EV-D68 pilot were met and to determine the benefits of and lessons learned from a rapid-response surveillance system for emerging pathogens. Methods: An evaluation survey was created and administered via a secure online link. All provinces and territories (PTs) and federal partners involved in the pilot were invited to complete one survey per jurisdiction (N=17). Proportions were calculated for responses to closed-ended questions and recurring themes were identified for open-ended questions. Results: Fifty four percent (7/13) of PTs and 50\% (2/4) of federal partners completed the survey. All four goals of the pilot were met to some degree. All respondents agreed that there were important benefits to rapid surveillance initiatives for emerging pathogens including the capacity to: better understand the epidemiological and clinical features as well as the public health risk of emerging pathogens (66.7\%); inform public health action (66.7\%); collaborate and avoid duplication of work (11.1\%); test and develop jurisdictional capacity (11.1\%); and inform future response efforts (11.1\%). Receiving timely case summaries (preferably weekly) was identified as important for 88\% of respondents. In terms of lessons learned, more than half of respondents (66.7\%) indicated that current processes needed to be improved in order to facilitate rapid surveillance initiatives within and across jurisdictions including the need to develop data-sharing agreements and have pre-existing protocols. Important factors identified for a surveillance data reporting platform included: ease of functionality, data security, jurisdictional control, web-based and flexibility to meet changing surveillance needs. Conclusion: Evaluation results from the EV-D68 surveillance pilot will assist with future rapid surveillance initiatives. It is important that lessons learned be addressed prior to the emergence of the next emerging pathogen.},

In light of concerns that there was a degree of laboratory underreporting of HIV which increased in 2013, we undertook an evaluation of the system, focusing on sensitivity and timeliness. We estimated underreporting by analysing new HIV diagnoses that were not notified in 2013 because they did not fit the nationally agreed criteria for notification (i.e. two serology positives on two separate samples). To assess timeliness, we used the national Computerised Infectious Disease Reporting System (CIDR) and National Virus Reference Laboratory (NVRL) 2012/2013 data to calculate median time intervals in HIV surveillance steps, from HIV first sample confirmation to completion of enhanced information in CIDR. In 2013, 71 new HIV diagnoses did not meet the criteria for notification to CIDR (sensitivity 82\%): 23 had one serology positive only and 48 had a second sample tested for viral loads which were undetectable. Of 665 notifications, the interval between NVRL first diagnosis and form completion varied from 20 (14-117; 11-239) to 49 (27-125; 12-252) days by DPH area. Overall, 81\% of notifications had enhanced information available 6 months after diagnosis. We recommend that reporting procedures are amended to notify on confirmation of HIV on the first sample at NVRL. The timeliness of the HIV surveillance system was in line with the American surveillance standard (66\% reported within 6 months of diagnosis). Reliable analysis of HIV trends can be undertaken within 6 months of diagnosis.},

Aim(s): The aim of this paper was to report on an evaluation of an RTSS system in South Yorkshire, England. Method(s): The system was reviewed, and outcome data were analyzed for 2019 and 2020 based on recorded suspected suicides, a stakeholder focus group, evaluation of postvention bereavement service outcomes, and lessons learned. Result(s): The benefits of RTSS included rapid response to emerging trends, identifying clusters, effective bereavement support, information to inform measures to mitigate risk, and supporting evaluation of interventions. The challenges faced included limited resources, data quality, consistency across places, and linkages with coronial processes. Limitation(s): This was an evaluation of one RTSS system based on routinely collected data covering one area, South Yorkshire, and hence some data limitations, and direct comparison with other services or against a control group was not possible. Conclusion(s): The RTSS system has led to better support for suicidal people and a responsive, timely, and effective service for those bereaved by suicide, all of which are likely to lead to enhanced well-being and community resilience.},

  abstract = {This study aimed to evaluate the data quality of the Brazilian Epidemiological Surveillance System on Foodborne Diseases (VE-DTA) through the evaluation of the completeness of the record after 10-years of its implementation. The study evaluated the measurement of completeness by quantifying ignored, incomplete or blank responses of the data items filled. The evaluation used the percentage of completion of these items regarding the total number of notifications registered in the system. We organized the results according to the general Category of completeness of the database, by year of notification and region of occurrence. We also evaluated the overall completeness percentages of the database and the completeness levels according to the degree of recommendation of completion of each variable (mandatory, essential, and complementary) by the VE-DTA manual. The system presented 7037 outbreaks of foodborne diseases. According to the completeness classification, the database presented general classification as Category 1 since it has 82.1\% (n = 5.777) of variables with the level of completion up to 75.1\%. We observed that 8.6\% of the database was classified as category 2; 9.2\% as category 3 and 0.1\% as category 4. The improvement on database quality regarding completeness can positively impact on public health and public policies, reducing the number of FBDs deaths.},

  abstract = {Disease surveillance programmes ought to be evaluated regularly to ensure they provide valuable information in an efficient manner. Evaluation of human and animal health surveillance programmes around the world is currently not standardized and therefore inconsistent. The aim of this systematic review was to review surveillance system attributes and the methods used for their assessment, together with the strengths and weaknesses of existing frameworks for evaluating surveillance in animal health, public health and allied disciplines. Information from 99 articles describing the evaluation of 101 surveillance systems was examined. A wide range of approaches for assessing 23 different system attributes was identified although most evaluations addressed only one or two attributes and comprehensive evaluations were uncommon. Surveillance objectives were often not stated in the articles reviewed and so the reasons for choosing certain attributes for assessment were not always apparent. This has the potential to introduce misleading results in surveillance evaluation. Due to the wide range of system attributes that may be assessed, methods should be explored which collapse these down into a small number of grouped characteristics by focusing on the relationships between attributes and their links to the objectives of the surveillance system and the evaluation. A generic and comprehensive evaluation framework could then be developed consisting of a limited number of common attributes together with several sets of secondary attributes which could be selected depending on the disease or range of diseases under surveillance and the purpose of the surveillance. Economic evaluation should be an integral part of the surveillance evaluation process. This would provide a significant benefit to decision-makers who often need to make choices based on limited or diminishing resources.},

The inclusion of socioeconomic criteria ensures that economic evaluation is an integral part of this framework. SERVAL was developed with input from a technical workshop of international experts followed by a consultation process involving providers and users of surveillance and evaluation data. It has been applied to a range of case studies encompassing different surveillance and evaluation objectives. Here, we describe the development, structure and application of the SERVAL framework. We discuss users' experiences in applying SERVAL to evaluate animal health surveillance systems in Great Britain.},

  abstract = {Background: Early warning and robust estimation of influenza burden are critical to inform hospital preparedness and operational, treatment, and vaccination policies. Methods to enhance influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance are regularly reviewed. We investigated the use of hospital staff 'influenza-like absences' (hospital staff-ILA), i.e. absence attributed to colds and influenza, to improve capture of influenza dynamics and provide resilience for hospitals. Method(s): Numbers and rates of hospital staff-ILA were compared to regional surveillance data on ILI primary-care presentations (15-64 years) and to counts of laboratory confirmed cases among hospitalised patients from April 2008 to April 2013 inclusive. Analyses were used to determine comparability of the ILI and hospital-ILA and how systems compared in early warning and estimating the burden of disease. Result(s): Among 20,021 reported hospital-ILA and 4661 community ILI cases, correlations in counts were high and consistency in illness measurements was observed. In time series analyses, both hospital-ILA and ILI showed similar timing of the seasonal component. Hospital-ILA data often commenced and peaked earlier than ILI according to a Bayesian prospective alarm algorithm. Hospital-ILA rates were more comparable to model-based estimates of 'true' influenza burden than ILI. Conclusion(s): Hospital-ILA appears to have the potential to be a robust, yet simple syndromic surveillance method that could be used to enhance estimates of disease burden and early warning, and assist with local hospital preparedness.Copyright {\copyright} Drumright et al.; licensee BioMed Central.}

We identified critical points in epidemiological surveillance networks using a modified version of the hazard analysis: critical control point (HACCP) method. An evaluation grid was then developed and validated by experts who were consulted in accordance with the Delphi method. A questionnaire to collect the information required for the evaluation and a scoring guide were then designed. Our evaluation procedure also included a calculation of the annual operating costs for two of the three networks studied. On the basis of the detailed results of the technical and economic evaluation, we formulated specific suggestions for improving the networks. The cost of implementing these proposals was calculated. We then simulated the effects of implementing each of the proposed improvements and a new global evaluation score was determined for each network. The 'cost per point' of each improvement was then calculated and discussed. This tool for the technical and economic evaluation of epidemiological surveillance networks for animal diseases is proposed so that it may be tested on a far wider scale and eventually be used in improving the functioning of such networks and for risk analysis in international trade.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is rapidly developing as a powerful public health tool. It can provide information about a wide range of health determinants (HDs), including community exposure to environmental hazards, trends in consumption of licit and illicit substances, spread of infectious diseases, and general community health. As such, the list of possible candidate HDs for WBE is almost limitless. Consequently, a means to evaluate and prioritize suitable candidates for WBE is useful, particularly for public health authorities, who often face resource constraints., OBJECTIVES: We have developed a framework to assist public health authorities to decide what HDs may be appropriate for WBE and what biomarkers could be used. This commentary reflects the experience of the authors, who work at the interface of research and public health implementation., DISCUSSION: To be suitable for WBE, a candidate HD should address a public health or scientific issue that would benefit from better understanding at the population level. For HDs where information on individual exposures or stratification by population subgroups is required, WBE is less suitable. Where other methodologies are already used to monitor the candidate HD, consideration must be given to whether WBE could provide better or complementary information to the current approach. An essential requirement of WBE is a biomarker specific for the candidate HD. A biomarker in this context refers to any human-excreted chemical or biological that could act as an indicator of consumption or exposure to an environmental hazard or of the human health state. Suitable biomarkers should meet several criteria outlined in this commentary, which requires background knowledge for both the biomarker and the HD. An evaluation tree summarizing key considerations for public health authorities when assessing the suitability of candidate HDs for WBE and an example evaluation are presented. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP11115.},

  abstract = {Introduction: National estimates for nonfatal self-directed violence (SDV) presenting at EDs are calculated from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System -- All Injury Program (NEISS--AIP). In 2005, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Consumer Product Safety Commission added several questions on patient characteristics and event circumstances for all intentional, nonfatal SDV captured in NEISS--AIP. In this study, we evaluated these additional questions along with the parent NEISS--AIP, which together is referred to as NEISS--AIP SDV for study purposes. Methods: We used a mixed methods design to evaluate the NEISS--AIP SDV as a surveillance system through an assessment of key system attributes. We reviewed data entry forms, the coding manual, and training materials to understand how the system functions. To identify strengths and weaknesses, we interviewed multiple key informants. Finally, we analyzed the NEISS--AIP SDV data from 2018---the most recent data year available---to assess data quality by examining the completeness of variables. Results: National estimates of SDV are calculated from NEISS--AIP SDV. Quality control activities suggest more than 99\% of the cause and intent variables were coded consistently with the open text field that captures the medical chart narrative. Many SDV variables have open-ended response options, making them difficult to efficiently analyze. Conclusions: NEISS--AIP SDV provides the opportunity to describe systematically collected risk factors and characteristics associated with nonfatal SDV that are not regularly available through other data sources. With some modifications to data fields and yearly analysis of the additional SDV questions, NEISS--AIP SDV can be a valuable tool for informing suicide prevention. Practical Applications: NEISS-AIP may consider updating the SDV questions and responses and analyzing SDV data on a regular basis. Findings from analyses of the SDV data may lead to improvements in ED care. {\copyright} 2020},

We cross-checked ANC records with HDSS pregnancy registrations and outcomes. Pregnancies observed in the ANC that were missing reports in the HDSS despite a data collection round following the expected delivery date were identified as likely adverse outcomes, and we investigated the characteristics of such individuals. Clinical data were used to investigate the timing of HDSS pregnancy registration relative to care seeking and gestational age, and examine misclassification of miscarriages and stillbirths., Results: From an analytical sample of 2,475 pregnancies observed in the ANC registers, 46\% had pregnancy registrations in the HDSS, and 89\% had retrospectively reported pregnancy outcomes. 1\% of registered pregnancies were missing outcomes, compared to 10\% of those lacking registration. Registered pregnancies had higher rates of stillbirth and perinatal mortality than those lacking registration. In 77\% of cases, women accessed ANC prior to registering the pregnancy in the HDSS. Half of reported miscarriages were misclassified stillbirths. We identified 141 unreported pregnancies that likely ended in adverse outcomes. Such cases were more common among those who visited ANC clinics during the first trimester, made fewer overall visits, were HIV-positive, and outside of formal union., Conclusions: Record linkage with ANC clinics revealed pregnancy underreporting in HDSS, resulting in biased measurement of perinatal mortality. Integrating records of ANC usage into routine data collection can augment HDSS pregnancy surveillance and improve monitoring of adverse pregnancy outcomes and early mortality.},

  abstract = {We evaluated the completeness and differential ascertainment of vital events in children less than five years old registered in two rounds of a demographic surveillance system (DSS) in western Kenya using a two-sample capture-recapture. The primary lists consisted of births and child deaths identified by two rounds of the DSS conducted in October 2000 and August 2001. The secondary lists consisted of births and child deaths identified independently from two surveys of 5,000 randomly selected households conducted immediately after each DSS round, covering the same population over the same time period. Analysis of the overlap between lists yielded the following sensitivities for the two DSS rounds: 62\% and 49\%, respectively, for identifying neonatal deaths ({$<$}1 month); 72\% and 78\%, respectively, for post-neonatal child deaths (1-59 months); and 88\% and 78\%, respectively, for identifying newborns. Female deaths were less likely to be reported than male deaths. The primary limitation of using capture-recapture in this setting was difficulty in matching between lists due to inconsistent dates of birth and death and variability in spelling of names. Assuming limitations of current methods are sufficiently addressed, capture-recapture appears to be a useful tool in evaluating DSS completeness and differential ascertainment of vital events.}

Smartphone applications (apps) have the potential to enhance surveillance data transmission., METHODS: The Central African Republic (CAR) Ministry of Health and Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) conducted a 15-week pilot project to test a disease surveillance app, Argus, for 20 conditions in 21 health centers in Mambere Kadei district (MK 2016). Results were compared to the usual paper-based surveillance in MK the year prior (MK 2015) and simultaneously in an adjacent health district, Nana-Mambere (NM 2016). Wilcoxon rank sum and Kaplan-Meier analyses compared report completeness and timeliness; the cost of the app, and users' perceptions of its usability were assessed., RESULTS: Two hundred seventy-one weekly reports sent by app identified 3403 cases and 63 deaths; 15 alerts identified 28 cases and 4 deaths. Median completeness (IQR) for MK 2016, 81\% (81-86\%), was significantly higher than in MK 2015 (31\% (24-36\%)), and NM 2016 (52\% (48-57)) (p {$<$} 0.01). Median timeliness (IQR) for MK 2016, 50\% (39-57\%) was also higher than in MK 2015, 19\% (19-24\%), and NM 2016 29\% (24-36\%) (p {$<$} 0.01). Kaplan-Meier Survival Analysis showed a significant progressive reduction in the time taken to transmit reports over the 15-week period (p {$<$} 0.01). Users ranked the app's usability as greater than 4/5 on all dimensions. The total cost of the 15-week pilot project was US\$40,575. It is estimated that to maintain the app in the 21 health facilities of MK will cost approximately US\$18,800 in communication fees per year., CONCLUSIONS: The app-based data transmission system more than doubled the completeness and timeliness of disease surveillance reports.

  abstract = {Veterinary and public health surveillance programs can be evaluated to assess and improve the planning, implementation and effectiveness of these programs. Guidelines, protocols and methods have been developed for such evaluation. In general, they focus on a limited set of attributes (e.g., sensitivity and simplicity), that are assessed quantitatively whenever possible, otherwise qualitatively. Despite efforts at standardization, replication by different evaluators is difficult, making evaluation outcomes open to interpretation. This ultimately limits the usefulness of surveillance evaluations. At the same time, the growing demand to prove freedom from disease or pathogen, and the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement and the International Health Regulations require stronger surveillance programs. We developed a method for evaluating veterinary and public health surveillance programs that is detailed, structured, transparent and based on surveillance concepts that are part of all types of surveillance programs. The proposed conceptual evaluation method comprises four steps: (1) text analysis, (2) extraction of the surveillance conceptual model, (3) comparison of the extracted surveillance conceptual model to a theoretical standard, and (4) validation interview with a surveillance program designer. This conceptual evaluation method was applied in 2005 to C-EnterNet, a new Canadian zoonotic disease surveillance program that encompasses laboratory based surveillance of enteric diseases in humans and active surveillance of the pathogens in food, water, and livestock. The theoretical standard used for evaluating C-EnterNet was a relevant existing structure called the "Population Health Surveillance Theory". Five out of 152 surveillance concepts were absent in the design of C-EnterNet. However, all of the surveillance concept relationships found in C-EnterNet were valid. The proposed method can be used to improve the design and documentation of surveillance programs. It complements existing surveillance evaluation methods. Conceptual evaluation is not a performance-oriented evaluation method and so it is particularly useful for surveillance programs with a valid conceptual framework but limited technical capacity and resources. Such programs would be penalized using existing performance-based evaluation methods. Applying conjointly the conceptual evaluation along with existing performance-oriented evaluation methods will better judge the worth of surveillance programs. We recommend developing a comprehensive surveillance evaluation framework for veterinary and public health surveillance programs that integrates all existing surveillance evaluation tools and provides an appropriate way to evaluate various types of surveillance programs.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Western Pacific Region (WPR) is exposed each year to seasonal influenza and is often the source of new influenza virus variants and novel pathogen emergence. National influenza surveillance systems play a critical role in detecting emerging viruses, monitoring influenza epidemics, improving public disease awareness and promoting pandemic preparedness, but vary widely across WPR countries. The aim of this study is to improve existing influenza surveillance systems by systematically comparing selected WPR influenza surveillance systems. METHOD(S): Three national influenza surveillance systems with different levels of development (Australia, China and Malaysia) were compared and their adherence to World Health Organization (WHO) guidance was evaluated using a structured framework previously tested in several European countries consisting of seven surveillance sub-systems, 19 comparable outcomes and five evaluation criteria. Based on the results, experts from the Asia-Pacific Alliance for the Control of Influenza (APACI) issued recommendations for the improvement of existing surveillance systems. RESULT(S): Australia demonstrated the broadest scope of influenza surveillance followed by China and Malaysia. In Australia, surveillance tools covered all sub-systems. In China, surveillance did not cover non-medically attended respiratory events, primary care consultations, and excess mortality modelling. In Malaysia, surveillance consisted of primary care and hospital sentinel schemes. There were disparities between the countries across the 5 evaluation criteria, particularly regarding data granularity from health authorities, information on data representativeness, and data communication, especially the absence of publicly available influenza epidemiological reports in Malaysia. This dual approach describing the scope of surveillance and evaluating the adherence to WHO guidance enabled APACI experts to make a number of recommendations for each country that included but were not limited to introducing new surveillance tools, broadening the use of specific existing surveillance tools, collecting and sharing data on virus characteristics, developing immunization status registries, and improving public health communication. CONCLUSION(S): Influenza monitoring in Australia, China, and Malaysia could benefit from the expansion of existing surveillance sentinel schemes, the broadened use of laboratory confirmation and the introduction of excess-mortality modelling. The results from the evaluation can be used as a basis to support expert recommendations and to enhance influenza surveillance capabilities.Copyright {\copyright} 2021. The Author(s).},

The Mozambique Ministry of Health (MOH) developed a 5-year strategy (2013-2017) for male voluntary medical circumcision (VMMC) to increase in the provinces where there is the greatest number of HIV. We aimed to evaluate the health information system for monitoring and evaluating VMMC in Mozambique from 2013-2019., Methods: we reviewed the records of the National Health Information System for Monitoring and Evaluation (SIS-MA) database for VMMC of the MOH. The evaluation was based on the updated guidelines for the evaluation of public health surveillance systems of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention., Results: the coverage rate for VMMC in Mozambique in the period under study was (89\%) (1,784,335/2,000,000). The system was expected to circumcise for the year 2019 (162,052) and 390,590 was reached, exceeding the target 241.0\% (390,590/162,052). Of the total number of men circumcised, 0.7\% (12,391/1,784,335) were HIV-positive (previously tested) and 0.4\% (6,382/1,784,335) had a record of adverse events in the period under review (2013-2019). Zambezia Province had the highest VMMC coverage (in numbers) at 16.0\% (396,876/2,476,395) while Maputo City had the least 19.7\% (107,104/543,096). The system was able to operate both online and offline and continue functioning with introducing new changes (e.g. the new male circumcision complication reporting)., Conclusion: the system was representative, flexible, simple, with good data quality and low acceptability. We recommended continuous and routine entry of quality data into the system, guide organizations for improved functioning. Copyright: Helio Inacio Elias et al.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Since 2004, the uptake of seasonal influenza vaccines in Latin America and the Caribbean has markedly increased. However, vaccine effectiveness (VE) is not routinely measured in the region. We assessed the feasibility of using routine surveillance data collected by sentinel hospitals to estimate influenza VE during 2012 against laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalizations in Costa-Rica, El Salvador, Honduras and Panama. We explored the completeness of variables needed for VE estimation., METHODS: We conducted the pilot case-control study at 23 severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) surveillance hospitals. Participant inclusion criteria included children 6 months-11 years and adults {$>$}=60 years targeted for vaccination and hospitalized for SARI during January-December 2012. We abstracted information needed to estimate target group specific VE (i.e., date of illness onset and specimen collection, preexisting medical conditions, 2012 and 2011 vaccination status and date, and pneumococcal vaccination status for children and adults) from SARI case-reports and for children {$<$}=9 years, inquired about the number of annual vaccine doses given. A case was defined as an influenza virus positive by RT-PCR in a person with SARI, while controls were RT-PCR negative. We recruited 3 controls per case from the same age group and month of onset of symptoms., RESULTS: We identified 1,186 SARI case-patients (342 influenza cases; 849 influenza-negative controls), of which 994 (84 \%) had all the information on key variables sought. In 893 (75 \%) SARI case-patients, the vaccination status field was missing in the SARI case-report forms and had to be completed using national vaccination registers (36 \%), vaccination cards (30 \%), or other sources (34 \%). After applying exclusion criteria for VE analyses, 541 (46 \%) SARI case-patients with variables necessary for the group-specific VE analyses were selected (87 cases, 236 controls among children; 64 cases, 154 controls among older adults) and were insufficient to provide precise regional estimates (39 \% for children and 25 \% for adults of minimum sample size needed)., CONCLUSIONS: Sentinel surveillance networks in middle income countries, such as some Latin American and Caribbean countries, could provide a simple and timely platform to estimate regional influenza VE annually provided SARI forms collect all necessary information.}

  abstract = {Background: There are limited data on the epidemiology of adolescent soccer injury across all levels of play. Hypothesis: Through implementation and validation of an injury surveillance system in adolescent soccer, risk factors for injury will be identified. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods: The study population was a random sample of 21 adolescent soccer teams (ages 12-18). A certified athletic therapist completed preseason baseline measurements and did weekly assessments of any identified soccer injury. The injury definition included any injury occurring in soccer that resulted in 1 or more of the following: medical attention, the inability to complete a session, or missing a subsequent session. Results: Based on completeness of data in addition to validity of time loss, this method of surveillance has proven to be effective. The overall injury rate during the regular season was 5.59 injuries per 1000 player hours (95\% confidence interval, 4.42-6.97). Soccer injury resulted in time loss from soccer for 86.9\% of the injured players. Ankle and knee injuries were the most common injuries reported. Direct contact was reported to be involved in 46.2\% of all injuries. There was an increased risk of injury associated with games versus practices (relative risk = 2.89; 95\% confidence interval, 1.69-5.21). The risk of injury in the under 14 age group was greatest in the most elite division. Having had a previous injury in the past 1 year increased the risk of injury (relative risk = 1.74; 95\% confidence interval, 1.0-3.1). Conclusion: There were significant differences in injury rates found by division, previous injury, and session type (practice vs game). Future research should include the use of such a surveillance system to examine prevention strategies for injury in adolescent soccer. {\copyright} 2005 American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine.}

From January to June 2016, the north-west Region reported 81 suspected cases of meningitis with 90\% from 4 districts and a 10\% case fatality rate. Aim A study was conducted to describe the cases and evaluate the surveillance system in those districts. Methods A descriptive study was conducted from January to June 2016 and the system was evaluated from January 2014 to June 2016. Data were collected using health facilities registers, medical case records and administration of a questionnaire to 30 health personnel in charge of surveillance. The case definition used was from the Cameroon guidelines for integrated disease surveillance and response. The attributes of the surveillance system were evaluated using the CDC guidelines for the evaluation of national surveillance systems. Results We identified 142 suspected cases of meningitis, including the 81 reported cases; 109 (76.8\%) were children {$<$}15 years. From 60 cases (42.2\%), cerebrospinal fluid was analyzed with 36 (60\%) showing no sign of meningitis, 12 (20\%) were probable cases of bacterial meningitis and 9 (15\%) of cryptococcal meningitis. No sample was sent to the referral laboratory due to the lack of transport medium. Of health workers interviewed, 20 (66.7\%) knew the case definition, 27 (90\%) said surveillance was part of their work. The sensitivity of the system was 75\% and the positive predictive value was 5.5\%. Conclusion There is an under-reporting of suspected cases of meningitis in the North-West Region. The system is accepted by health actors but not simple. The sensitivity and positive predictive value are not satisfactory. The strengthening of the surveillance system including response measures are needed.},

  abstract = {Atypical femoral fractures (AFFs) have been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates (BPs) for osteoporosis therapy but also in patients with no exposure to these drugs. In contrast, less is known about the incidence of AFFs in patients taking denosumab. This registry-based cohort study analyzed the incidence of AFFs in patients with suspected or confirmed osteoporosis who were included in the osteoporosis register of the Swiss Society of Rheumatology between January 2015 and September 2019. Statistical analyses included incidence rates, rate ratios, and hazard ratios for AFFs, and considered sequential therapies and drug holidays as time-dependent covariates. Among the 9956 subjects in the cohort, 53 had subtrochanteric or femoral shaft fractures. Ten fractures occurred under BP or denosumab treatment and two under teriparatide therapy. Five fractures were classified as AFFs based on the revised American Society of Bone and Mineral Research case definition of AFFs from 2014. Three AFFs occurred in women being treated with denosumab at the time of diagnosis, all with prior BP use (10, 7, and 1\,years, respectively). One AFF developed in a woman receiving ibandronate and one arose in a woman receiving glucocorticoids rather than antiresorptive therapy. The incidence of AFFs per 10,000 observed patient-years was 7.1 in patients receiving denosumab and 0.9 in patients with BP-associated AFFs, yielding a rate ratio of 7.9 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.63-413), p~=~0.073. The risk of AFFs was not significantly higher in patients receiving denosumab therapy compared with BP therapy (hazard ratio~=~7.07, 95\% CI 0.74-68.01, p~=~0.090). We conclude that the risk of AFFs is low in patients taking BPs, denosumab, or both sequentially. All three patients with AFFs under denosumab therapy had undergone prior BP therapy. {\copyright} 2022 The Authors.

Although syndromic surveillance has increased in developing countries, performance on outbreak detection, particularly in cases of multi-stream surveillance, has scarcely been evaluated in rural areas., OBJECTIVE: This study introduces a temporal simulation model based on healthcare-seeking behaviors to evaluate the performance of multi-stream syndromic surveillance for influenza-like illness., METHODS: Data were obtained in six towns of rural Hubei Province, China, from April 2012 to June 2013. A Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered model generated 27 scenarios of simulated influenza A (H1N1) outbreaks, which were converted into corresponding simulated syndromic datasets through the healthcare-behaviors model. We then superimposed converted syndromic datasets onto the baselines obtained to create the testing datasets. Outbreak performance of single-stream surveillance of clinic visit, frequency of over the counter drug purchases, school absenteeism, and multi-stream surveillance of their combinations were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves and activity monitoring operation curves., RESULTS: In the six towns examined, clinic visit surveillance and school absenteeism surveillance exhibited superior performances of outbreak detection than over the counter drug purchase frequency surveillance; the performance of multi-stream surveillance was preferable to signal-stream surveillance, particularly at low specificity (Sp {$<$}90\%)., CONCLUSIONS: The temporal simulation model based on healthcare-seeking behaviors offers an accessible method for evaluating the performance of multi-stream surveillance.},

Methods: Microsoft Excel 2010 was used to collect and classify the automatic early warning information data of infectious diseases in Jiangxi from 2015 to 2019, and SPSS 22.0 was used to statistically evaluate the application of early warning system and the quality of information reporting. Results: From 2015 to 2019, a total of 43 697 early warning signals were released in Jiangxi. The proportion of suspected event reached peak during September-December, and the proportion of positive early warning signals reached peaks in September and December. The proportions of suspected event, positive early warning signals and proportion of public health emergencies were 7.41\%, 0.78\% and 40.46\% respectively, Compared with 2008-2014, there were significant increases and there were significant differences in the proportion of suspected events (? 2=3 140.745, P {$<$} 0.001), the proportion of positive early warning signals (? 2=305.895, P {$<$} 0.001) and the proportion of public health emergencies (? 2=18.585, P {$<$} 0.001); The top five diseases with the positive early warning signals were human infection with Streptococcus suis, human infection with avian influenza (H7N9) virus, dengue fever, cholera and unexplained pneumonia; The timely response rate of early warning signal and field investigation rate were 98.34\% and 82.25\% respectively, which increased significantly compared with 2008-2014. There were significant differences in the timely response rate of early warning signal (? 2=21 680.642, P {$<$} 0.001) and field investigation rate (? 2=109.642, P {$<$} 0.001). Conclusion: The performance of automatic early warning information system of infectious diseases in Jiangxi is well, the early warning efficiency has been improved obviously, resulting in timely response. However, the overall proportions of positive early warning signal and early warning of public health emergency are still at low levels, suggesting that the early warning system of infectious disease needs to be further optimized.},

  abstract = {The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) presents the Surveillance Evaluation Tool (SET) Manual: a comprehensive methodology to guide assessors in implementing SET and ensuring that the assessments between countries are of an equally high standard. SET enables countries to enhance their veterinary services' capacities with specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound action plans.SET is used during a two-week in-country mission led by evaluators from FAO and the national focal points of veterinary services. These missions are designed to provide recommendations and action plans to improve countries' animal disease surveillance systems. This manual gives SET assessors a full mission breakdown as well as a step-by-step approach for making robust evaluations and precise recommendations.SET reveals the strengths and weaknesses of the assessed surveillance system, encompassing the country's institutional organization, laboratory operations, surveillance activities, epidemiologic surveillance workforce, data management, communications, and evaluation, all which are divided into 96 indicators in addition to ones for bioterrorism and agrocrime response under the SET Biothreat Detection Module. The SET Manual is an essential resource for any assessor in delivering objective, useful evaluations and ultimately strengthening countries' animal disease surveillance systems.},

  abstract = {This study was performed to evaluate the health information system regarding the dengue surveillance system in Indonesia. Major obstacles to the implementation of an effective health information system regarding dengue cases in Bandung are examined, and practical suggestions on measures to overcome them are discussed. The study utilized a mixed-method research design using qualitative approaches: document analysis, key informants and focus group interviews. Thirty key informants were selected, comprised of policymakers, senior managers, and staff at the Ministry of Health. Data from documents and transcripts were evaluated through a modified Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework described by Ostrom. Through this study, we have identified several issues that hinder the effective implementation of the health information system in the case of dengue in Bandung. In the end, we propose several recommendations for reform that encompasses motivational, strategic, and structural approaches to each component of the analysis. Through evaluation of the health information system for dengue surveillance in Indonesia, we conclude that well-coordination in multi-level governance in a country as large as Indonesia is the key in the implementation of the health information system in different levels of agencies. Furthermore, the adaptability of human resources in adopting a new information system also plays an important part.},

This study's objective was to evaluate the system for the purpose to monitor patients receiving ART., Methods: data from 287,052 patients who started ART from January to December 2017 were verified, and retention in care was assessed for 2018 in Mozambique. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for evaluating public health surveillance systems were used to conduct the evaluation. Simplicity, flexibility, data quality, representativeness and stability attributes were evaluated., Results: a total of 93\% (266,880/287,052) of patients on ART were adults {$>$}=15 years old, and 65\% (186,677/287,052) were female. The system was complex, it involved four organisations and its management was online. Data quality was moderate with 19\% (1,533,885/8,037,456) of empty variable fields, 0.04\% (123/287,052) observations with birth date later than the initial ART date, 0.2\% (424/287,052) and 23\% (68,039/287,052) with initial ART date and diagnosis date, later than the next ART pickup date. Nationally, 19\%(31/161) of the districts did not have data in the information system. MozART cover health facilities with electronic patient tracking systems. Hence did not represent all patients on ART. While it was not possible to add variables of the electronic patient tracking, the system was stable as neither data or server interruptions were reported., Conclusion: the system was useful, stable, with moderate data quality, complex, not flexible and not representative. We recommend to health facilities and partners to develop and distribute procedures for data validation and completeness and report all patient tracking variables in the system.

  abstract = {Introduction Tuberculosis (TB) is a communicable disease that remains a major global health problem and one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide and the leading cause of death from a single infectious agent ranking above HIV/AIDS. Globally, an estimated 10.0 million (range, 8.9-11.0 million) people fell ill with the disease in with the death of 1.2 million in 2019. In Tanzania, TB incidence has fallen from 306 per 100,000 population in 2015 to 253 per 100,000 in 2018. Surveillance system evaluation is very important for funders and stakeholders to know if the system meets its intended objectives. The aim was to assess the performance of the surveillance system for routine TB testing at Central TB Reference Laboratory (CTRL) whether it is meeting its set objectives, assess its usefulness and describe its attributes. Methods The TB surveillance system was evaluated using Centre for Disease Control and Prevention updated guidelines for evaluating public health surveillance systems 2006. Records and TB database were reviews from 2017 to 2020 to assess objectives of the system and attributes of the system at Central Tuberculosis Reference Laboratory (CTRL), Bugando Medical Centre Laboratory (BMCL), Misungwi and Magu District Hospital. Interviews were conducted at the various levels using a semi-structured questionnaire and data analysis done with Epi info 7 and Microsoft Excel to run frequencies and percentages. Results The surveillance system is well structured with standardized data collection tools. The system was found to be useful and met its objectives. It was also found to be simple, flexible, and fairly stable with average timeliness in TAT but partially in transit time. It had low acceptability and low geographically representative. It had low sensitivity of 6.8\% at BMCL and a moderate CTRL of 66.17\%. Predictive value positive was low for both CTRL and BMCL with 23.43\% and 19.12\% respectively. Conclusion The surveillance system was found to be useful and met its objectives. There is a need to improve the sensitivity, predictive value positive, timeliness (transit time), representativeness, and acceptability.},

As a laboratory notifiable disease in NSW, information is not routinely available on indigenous status, sexual preference or other risk factors for infection. We conducted a 12-month pilot of enhanced surveillance in south-eastern Sydney in order to assess the feasibility of gathering this additional information., Methods: For each notification in a south-eastern Sydney resident with a 2013 specimen date, we sent a letter and questionnaire to the requesting doctor seeking additional demographic and risk factor information., Results: Of 1,341 questionnaires sent, 1,073 (79.5\%) were returned, and men comprised 947 (88.3\%). Indigenous status was provided for 1,009 (94.1\%) cases, with seven (0.7\%) identified as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. Most men (83\%) but a minority of women (19\%) had same sex partners (p{$<$}0.001). Whilst 70\% of men reported acquisition from a casual partner, only 46\% of women thought they had acquired infection from a casual partner., Conclusions: The high response rate and completeness of indigenous status were strong features of this enhanced surveillance pilot which also provided valuable information on sexual preference and other risk factors for infection. However, gathering of this information was very labour intensive for both clinical and public health staff. Copyright {\copyright} Commonwealth of Australia CC BY-NC-ND},

Because of this substantial burden of disease, we performed a three-part evaluation of Tennessee's routine surveillance for SFG rickettsioses cases and deaths to assess the system's effectiveness. Tennessee Department of Health (TDH) SFG rickettsioses surveillance records were matched to three patient series: 1) patients with positive serologic specimens from a commercial reference laboratory during 2010-2011, 2) tertiary medical center patients with positive serologic tests during 2007-2013, and 3) patients identified from death certificates issued during 1995-2014 with SFG rickettsiosis-related causes of death. Chart reviews were performed and patients were classified according to the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists' case definition. Of 254 SFG Rickettsia-positive serologic specimens from the reference laboratory, 129 (51\%) met the case definition for confirmed or probable cases of rickettsial disease after chart review. The sensitivity of the TDH surveillance system to detect cases was 45\%. Of the 98 confirmed or probable cases identified from the medical center, the sensitivity of the TDH surveillance system to detect cases was 34\%. Of 27 patients identified by death certificates, 12 (44\%) were classified as confirmed or probable cases; four (33\%) were reported to TDH, but none were correctly identified as deceased. Cases of SFG rickettsioses were underreported and fatalities not correctly identified. Efforts are needed to improve SFG rickettsiosis surveillance in Tennessee.},

Two categories were created to analyze the results: "Man-agement" and "Team" in dialogue with references from Management, Evaluation and Health Surveillance. Most "management" and "teamwork" sub-realms were deemed satisfactory. Self-assessment evaluation through an applied evaluation tool was shown to be a powerful resource for the analysis of Health Surveillance practices in combination with other devices adopted by the Unified Health System (SUS). Unlike usual evaluation processes guided by quantitative markers, this self-assessable evaluative process included subjects and enabled the possibility of incorporating a new look at itself to the way Health Surveillance is carried out and support future management contracts between workers and managers.},

  abstract = {Emergency department (ED)-based syndromic surveillance systems are being used by public health departments to monitor for outbreaks of infectious diseases, including bioterrorism; however, few systems have been validated. The authors evaluated a "drop-in" syndromic surveillance system by comparing syndrome categorization in the ED with chief complaints and ED discharge diagnoses from medical record review. A surveillance form was completed for each ED visit at 15 participating Arizona hospitals between October 27 and November 18, 2001. Each patient visit was assigned one of ten clinical syndromes or "none." For six of 15 EDs, kappa statistics were used to compare syndrome agreement between surveillance forms and syndrome categorization with chief complaint and ED discharge diagnosis from medical record review. Overall, agreement between surveillance forms and ED discharge diagnoses (kappa = 0.55; 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.52 to 0.59) was significantly higher than between surveillance forms and chief complaints (kappa = 0.48; 95\% CI = 0.44 to 0.52). Agreement between chief complaints and ED discharge diagnoses was poor for respiratory tract infection with fever (kappa = 0.33; 95\% CI = 0.27 to 0.39). Furthermore, pediatric chief complaints showed lower agreement for respiratory tract infection with fever when compared with adults (kappa = 0.34 [95\% CI = 0.20 to 0.47] vs. kappa = 0.44 [95\% CI = 0.28 to 0.59], respectively). In general, this syndromic surveillance system classified patients into appropriate syndrome categories with fair to good agreement compared with chief complaints and discharge diagnoses. The present findings suggest that use of ED discharge diagnoses, in addition to or instead of chief complaints, may increase surveillance validity for both automated and drop-in syndromic surveillance systems.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The temporal sensitivity of the surveillance system (TemSSe) for Bovine Viral Diarrhea (BVD) in Danish dairy herds was evaluated. Currently, the Danish antibody blocking ELISA is used to test quarterly bulk tank milk (BTM). To optimize the surveillance system as an early warning system, we considered the possibility of using the SVANOVIR ELISA, as this test has been shown to detect BVD-positive herds earlier than the blocking ELISA in BTM tests. Information from data (2010) and outputs from two published stochastic models were fed into a stochastic scenario tree to estimate the TemSSe. For that purpose we considered: the risk of BVD introduction into the dairy population, the ELISA used and the high risk period (HRP) from BVD introduction to testing (at 90 or 365 days). The effect of introducing one persistently infected (PI) calf or one transiently infected (TI) milking cow into 1 (or 8) dairy herd(s) was investigated. Additionally we estimated the confidence in low (PLow) herd prevalence ({$<$}8/4109 infected herds) and the confidence in complete freedom (PFree) from BVD ({$<$} 1/4109)., RESULTS: The TemSSe, the PLow, and the PFree were higher, when tests were performed 365 days after BVD introduction, than after 90 days. Estimates were usually higher for the SVANOVIR than for the blocking ELISA, and when a PI rather than a TI was introduced into the herd(s). For instance, with the current system, the median TemSSe was 64.5 \%, 90 days after a PI calf was introduced into eight dairy herds. The related median PLow was 72.5 \%. When a PI calf was introduced into one herd the median TemSSe was 12.1 \%, while the related PFree was 51.6 \%. With the SVANOVIR ELISA these estimates were 99.0 \%; 98.9 \%, 43.7 \% and 62.4 \%, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: The replacement of the blocking ELISA with the SVANOVIR could increase the TemSSe, the PLow and PFree remarkably. Those results could be used to optimize the Danish BVD surveillance system. Furthermore, the approach proposed in this study, for including the effect of the HRP within the scenario tree methodology, could be applied to optimize early warning surveillance systems of different animal diseases.},

  abstract = {The English surveillance system for bovine brucellosis was evaluated. The confidence in detecting at least one infected herd in the local population (surveillance system sensitivity or SSe), and the confidence in freedom from disease (PFree) adjusted (PFreeAdj) for the probability of disease introduction from abroad by imported animals (PIntro), were estimated for quarterly surveillance periods of 2016; because dairy herds were tested quarterly on bulk tank milk (BTM) with an antibody indirect ELISA. A stochastic model was developed and six surveillance components (representing also the local population strata), were evaluated. All English herds and their relative risk (RRs) of infection within each stratum were considered. The importance of each component was assessed using actual national data, which reflected non-random sampling. The contribution of the abortions testing was assessed with particular focus, because a decline in statutory submissions was observed in recent years. Beef herds without submissions (B-NoTest herds) at the laboratories were still considered as a population stratum, where infected cattle could be imported. Additionally, we evaluated the importance of different hypothetical design between-herds prevalence (Ph) values, at which the country could be classified as "infected". The potential negative effect on SSe due to the dilution of antibodies when individual samples are pooled within BTM and tested by the milk iELISA, was also investigated. The quarterly median SSe and PFreeAdj were both {$>$}= 95 \% if at least four (0.008 \%) herds were infected in the country due to independent import events. The system appeared able to substantiate Official Brucellosis Free (OBF) status frequently (on quarterly basis) using Ph=0.2 \% (EU legislation). The component based only on BTM testing (M herds) showed the highest sensitivity; while the surveillance components based on abortions or post import calving (PIC) testing, had very low sensitivity at the (considered) Ph values lower than 0.2 \%. In contrast, at Ph = 0.2 \%, components based on abortion testing had median sensitivity between 91.3 \% and 99.9 \%, and the dilution effect on BTM testing did not change remarkably the SSe and PFreeAdj. When Ph was set to 1-2 infected herds (0.002-0.004 \%), these were usually allocated by the model within the B-NoTest stratum (the largest stratum) and SSe reduced. Thus, if policy considers necessary increasing the SSe for low Phs (system's optimization as an early warning system); the cost efficiency of active risk based surveillance in beef herds (considering imports) could be investigated in the future.

  abstract = {The populations impacted most by COVID are also impacted by racism and related social stigma; however, traditional surveillance tools may not capture the intersectionality of these relationships. We conducted a detailed assessment of diverse surveillance systems and databases to identify characteristics, constraints and best practices that might inform the development of a novel COVID surveillance system that achieves these aims. We used subject area expertise, an expert panel and CDC guidance to generate an initial list of N {$>$} 50 existing surveillance systems as of 29 October 2020, and systematically excluded those not advancing the project aims. This yielded a final reduced group (n = 10) of COVID surveillance systems (n = 3), other public health systems (4) and systems tracking racism and/or social stigma (n = 3, which we evaluated by using CDC evaluation criteria and Critical Race Theory. Overall, the most important contribution of COVID-19 surveillance systems is their real-time (e.g., daily) or near-real-time (e.g., weekly) reporting; however, they are severely constrained by the lack of complete data on race/ethnicity, making it difficult to monitor racial/ethnic inequities. Other public health systems have validated measures of psychosocial and behavioral factors and some racism or stigma-related factors but lack the timeliness needed in a pandemic. Systems that monitor racism report historical data on, for instance, hate crimes, but do not capture current patterns, and it is unclear how representativeness the findings are. Though existing surveillance systems offer important strengths for monitoring health conditions or racism and related stigma, new surveillance strategies are needed to monitor their intersecting relationships more rigorously.Copyright {\copyright} 2021 by the authors.

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Tuberculosis (TB) was the leading cause of death from an infectious illness globally with an estimated 10.4 million new cases and 1.4 million deaths in 2015. In Ghana, from the 2013 TB prevalence survey conducted by the National Tuberculosis Control Programme, the incidence is estimated as 165 per 100,000 population and a mortality rate of 7.5 per 1,000 infected people. The Tuberculosis surveillance system is part of the general framework of the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response. This evaluation was to assess whether the system is meeting its set objectives, assess its usefulness and describe its attributes., METHODS: The TB surveillance system of the Ashaiman municipality was evaluated using Centre for Disease Control and Prevention updated guidelines for evaluating public health surveillance systems 2006. Records review from 2014 to 2016 was done to assess objectives of the system and surveillance data source of 2016 was used to assess attributes. Interviews were conducted at the various levels using semi-structured questionnaire and data analysis done with Epi info 7 and Microsoft Excel to run frequencies and percentages., RESULTS: The surveillance system is well structured with standardized data collection tools. The system was found to be useful, though it just partially met its objectives. It was also found to be simple, flexible and fairly stable with average timeliness. It had low acceptability and is not geographically representative. It had low sensitivity of 45/100,000 and a low predictive value positive of 6.6\%., CONCLUSION: The surveillance system was found to be useful but partially met its objectives. There is the need to improve the sensitivity, predictive value positive timeliness and acceptability.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Epidemiological surveillance (ES) which is a continuous systematic process of data collection, analysis and interpretation for decision-making is of paramount importance for a good health system. Thus, to contribute to the improvement of the health system in Senegal, a study of the functioning of the routine epidemiological surveillance system was conducted in Tambacounda from S1 to S53 of the year 2020. Methodology: A descriptive and analytical cross-sectional study was conducted from 1 to 17 July 2021. Comprehensive recruitment of the district's 44 health care points was carried out. Data collection was carried out through a questionnaire prepared, pre-tested and administered to the 44 heads of public and non-public health facilities. The analyses were carried out with R software version 4.0.5. Result(s): Of the 44 health facilities surveyed, 64\% were public and 36\% were non-public. The completeness and timeliness of the data were 100\% and 97.5\%, respectively. Suspected cases of tuberculosis were the most reported. For the providers surveyed (n=44), only 65.9\% had knowledge of disease under epidemiological surveillance (DUES) and 93.2\% managed suspected cases. On-site data analysis is only performed by 20.5\% of providers. Only 38.6\% of the service delivery point (SDP) had a health area card and the ES was under the responsibility of 77.3\% of the paramedics. The training of ES officials was effective for only 45.5\% of them. Despite the availability of dry tubes (69.8\%), only 29.5\% of PSD had COVID sampling equipment. The contribution of local authorities and technical and financial partners (TFP) to the SE was 22.7\% and 29.5\% respectively. There was a statistically significant link between public SDP with knowledge of DUES (p {$<$}0.001), display of case definitions (p {$<$}0.001), feedback of reported cases, knowledge of indicators (p {$<$}0.001), existence of a health area map (p {$<$}0.001), advocacy with authorities (p=0.003), staff training (p=0.002), availability of DUES vaccines (p {$<$}0.001), availability of notification form (p {$<$}0.001) and partner contribution to ES activities. Conclusion(s): Staff training, regular monitoring of ES activities with greater involvement of nonpublic structures, and the availability of inputs applied to the six pillars of the health system, are essential elements on which action must be taken. for an efficient ES system in the Tambacounda health district for the benefit of the country's health system.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

  abstract = {Electronic event-based biosurveillance systems (EEBS's) that use near real-time information from the internet are an increasingly important source of epidemiologic intelligence. However, there has not been a systematic assessment of EEBS evaluations, which could identify key uncertainties about current systems and guide EEBS development to most effectively exploit web-based information for biosurveillance. To conduct this assessment, we searched PubMed and Google Scholar to identify peer-reviewed evaluations of EEBS's. We included EEBS's that use publicly available internet information sources, cover events that are relevant to human health, and have global scope. To assess the publications using a common framework, we constructed a list of 17 EEBS attributes from published guidelines for evaluating health surveillance systems. We identified 11 EEBS's and 20 evaluations of these EEBS's. The number of published evaluations per EEBS ranged from 1 (Gen-Db, GODsN, MiTAP) to 8 (GPHIN, HealthMap). The median number of evaluation variables assessed per EEBS was 8 (range, 3-15). Ten published evaluations contained quantitative assessments of at least one key variable. No evaluations examined usefulness by identifying specific public health decisions, actions, or outcomes resulting from EEBS outputs. Future EEBS assessments should identify and discuss critical indicators of public health utility, especially the impact of EEBS's on public health response.}

Our objective was to evaluate the timeliness of enteric disease surveillance in British Columbia, Canada, compare these results to other settings, and recommend improvements. In 2012 and 2013, information was collected from case report forms and laboratory information systems on 2615 Salmonella, shigatoxin-producing E. coli, Shigella, and Listeria infections. Twelve date variables representing the surveillance process from onset of symptoms to case interview and final laboratory results were collected, and intervals were measured. The median time from onset of symptoms to reporting subtyping results to BC epidemiologists was 26-36 days and from onset of symptoms to case interview was 12-14 days. Our findings were comparable to the international literature except for a longer time (up to 29 day difference) to reporting of PFGE results to epidemiologists in BC. Such a delay may impact our ability to identify and solve outbreaks. Several process and system changes were implemented which should improve the timeliness of enteric disease surveillance.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the SINAN software, quality of data input, the transfer of the computerised data from the municipality to state levels, human resources and other factors associated with the health information system infrastructure (HIS)., METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out in Pernambuco state, North-eastern Brazil, in 2005. A sample of health regions and municipalities was chosen. SINAN forms from those municipalities were analysed and the flow of notifications followed from municipal level to the regional and finally to the state. Professionals from health units, district, municipal and regional Hansen's Disease Control Programme (HDCP) and Epidemiological Surveillance System (ESS) coordinators, health secretaries and managers of the municipalities and health regions selected were interviewed., RESULTS: SINAN software is functioning up to expectation. However, at all levels of the health system, serious weaknesses not related to the SINAN software were found, varying from lack of human resources (limited number of staff and staff development), lack of infrastructure (office space, computers, supplies, etc.) to an absence of effective coordination, management and supervision of the HIS., CONCLUSIONS: Lack of reliable, complete and timely information, and especially the lack of widespread analysis and use of available information in planning and management of health services were the main weaknesses found. Many areas need urgent attention: the quality of patient examination, recording and reporting, the timely processing of quality data, the coordination and management of disease control programmes, and the use of HIS reports by the health services and health managers. Regular feedback, supportive supervision visits and annual reviews are essential to monitor the system and make sure that essential information is decentralised and used by the primary health services and HDCP coordination. Assessing the quality of services from a client perspective would give additional information for the identification of strengths and weaknesses of the Hansen's disease (leprosy) services.},

In addition, the applicability of TOPSIS and RSR in evaluating the quality of influenza surveillance was also discussed. Methods: Indicators were selected according to the national influenza surveillance program for a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of sentinel hospitals (5 indicators) and network laboratories (6 indicators) in China from 2013 to 2019 by using TOPSIS and RSR. Results: TOPSIS results showed that the first, median, and third quartiles of C values in sentinel hospitals and laboratories increased from 2013 to 2019. RSR results showed that the grading boundaries of sentinel hospitals and laboratories showed an overall increasing trend. Compared with 2013, the RSR grade increased in 188 sentinel hospitals, decreased in 99 sentinel hospitals and remained in 224 sentinel hospitals in 2019, and the RSR grade increased in 113 laboratories, decreased in 76 laboratories and remained in 128 laboratories in 2019. Conclusion: The overall surveillance quality of sentinel hospitals and network laboratories in China has been improved. The results of TOPSIS and RSR were objective and reliable, which could be applied in the quality evaluation of influenza-like illness surveillance.},

The European Commission co-funded project SlDARTH a (Grant Agreement No. 2007208) implements and evaluates a real-time syndromic surveillance system (SSS) in four European regions that analyses pre-hospital emergency medical dispatch (EMD), emergency physician service and in-hospital emergency department (ED) data. The performance of the pilot SSS was evaluated for timeliness, flexibility, sensitivity and specificity taking the A/H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009 and the lcelandic volcanic ash cloud in April 2010 as case studies. Spatial and temporal detection algorithms (e.g., C1, C2, C3) were applied on the daily number of Influenza-Like Illness (ILl) cases. Results were compared to sentinel data of public health authorities. The number of respiratory and cardiovascular syndrome cases and traffic accidents were assessed for the health impact of the volcanic ash cloud. Analyses showed an increase in lLl in ED data which correlated with respective reference data(Cantabria/Spain: r =0.75 (p {$<$} 0.001), R2 = 56.5\%). Peaks were detected earlier or at the same time as compared to sentinel data (Cantabria/Spain: Sensitivity= 55.6\%; Specificity= 81.3\%). During the time in which the volcanic ash cloud covered Europe no significant aberrations were detected compared to 2009. Only one alert regarding respiratory syndromes was issued (Tyrol/Austria: n=11 on 19-4-2010). No spatial cluster was identified. The case studies demonstrated the usefulness of emergency data for syndromic surveillance in Europe. As shown in other SSS for seasonal influenza the ED provided timely and sensitive information on the onset of the H1N1 pandemic. No link of the alert in Austria to the ash cloud can be expected. SlDARTH a was immediately adapted after the volcanic eruption showing SSS capability for ad hoc surveillance and situational awareness.},

The Dutch surveillance is dominated by a high level of transdisciplinary and trans-sectoral collaboration, enabling communication and data sharing among actors. Different project-based monitoring, research and educational activities are centrally coordinated and the non-scientific community is actively involved. All this yielded measurable health outcomes. In Italy and Spain, TBD surveillance and reporting systems are based on compulsory notification. Law enforcement, alongside dedicated time and availability of economic resources, is fragmented and limited to the most severe health issues. Veterinary and human medicine are the most involved disciplines, with the first prevailing in some contexts. Stakeholders are marginally considered and collaborations limited to local initiatives. Research activities have mostly contributed to gaining knowledge on the distribution of tick vectors and discovery of new pathogens. Although all TBD surveillance plans comply with EU regulations, initiatives characterised by transdisciplinary collaboration may be more effective for the surveillance and prevention of TBD.},

Distribution of cases was mapped using ArcGIS.54 clinical (with laboratory confirmation-45) cases, obtained by surveillance system, were examined. Infection occurred mainly in Syunik-19 (35.1\%) \& Tavush-12 (22.2\%) regions due to the expansion of the geographical range of Ixodes ricinus. The peak of infection occurs in June-July (a significant correlation with the cycle development of ticks to the stage of nymphs \& adults, 28\% of ticks was infected with B. burgdorfery (PCR test).

Despite the fact that 29(97\%) of the seroprevalence study participants reported chronic symptoms of LD \& ticks' bites in the past-93 (92\%), before this study no one had been tested for LD or included in statistics. LD is underdiagnosed, the surveillance system is not sensitive to chronic diseases cases.

  abstract = {Background and Objectives: To provide an overview of the national program of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever surveillance in Iran, its current achievements, and challenges. Method(s): In this mixed method study, the relevant reports, documents, and guidelines, as well as published literature and surveillance data were gathered and critically reviewed. The opinions of the key informants at local and governmental levels were assessed through structured interviews. Result(s): The program was integrated into Iran's primary healthcare (PHC) network in 1999. The involved organizations include CDC, medical universities, Pasteur Institute of Iran (PII), and Veterinary Organization. Case finding is based on standard definitions of suspected, probable, and confirmed cases. Laboratory confirmation is necessary for diagnosis and is provided within 48 hours after receipt of the specimen by the National Reference Laboratory of PII. CCHF treatment is primarily supportive. Antiviral therapy with ribavirin is also considered. Both therapeutic services are free. Education mainly focuses on high-risk groups and healthcare workers. Major achievements of the program include rapid diagnosis and treatment of cases, prevention of nosocomial transmission, identification of high-risk provinces and major transmission routes, improved outbreak preparedness, development of laboratory tests for detection of other arboviruses, and reduction of CCHF case fatality rate. Conclusion(s): Program implementation has had a positive impact on early detection and proper control of annual outbreaks. However, some aspects of the program still need improvement, including promotion of the general and high-risk populations' awareness and regional collaborations (especially among neighboring countries) for infection control in humans, livestock, and vectors.Copyright {\copyright} 2019, Iranian Epidemiological Association.

  abstract = {SETTING: Tuberculosis (TB) control requires accurate knowledge of TB incidence, but few studies have been published on TB incidence using individual data from drug prescriptions. OBJECTIVE(S): To measure the estimated completeness of regional surveillance system data before and after adding data from anti-tuberculosis drug prescriptions. DESIGN: We compiled data on all individuals who received specific anti-tuberculosis drugs from three sources - the passive surveillance system, the active surveillance system and the anti-tuberculosis drug prescription database - in the Balearic Islands, Spain, between 2010 and 2012. We applied the capturerecapture method to measure completeness of data reporting. Statistical significance was set at P {$<$} 0.05, and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. RESULT(S): We detected 605 incident cases, compared with an estimated incidence of 719 cases (95\%CI 646- 793), representing 84.1\% data completeness. We detected 480 of an estimated 559 pulmonary TB cases (95\%CI 501-617; 85.9\% data completeness) and 125 of an estimated 161 extra-pulmonary TB cases (95\%CI 113-211; 77.6\% data completeness). CONCLUSION(S): By adding a new source, we increased detection with respect to a previous study by 10.4\% for all forms of TB, 9.7\% for pulmonary TB and 13\% for extra-pulmonary TB.Copyright {\copyright} 2018 The Union.},

  abstract = {Dengue is a common and growing problem worldwide, with an estimated 70-140 million cases per year. Traditional, healthcare-based, government-implemented dengue surveillance is resource intensive and slow. As global Internet use has increased, novel, Internet-based disease monitoring tools have emerged. Google Dengue Trends (GDT) uses near real-time search query data to create an index of dengue incidence that is a linear proxy for traditional surveillance. Studies have shown that GDT correlates highly with dengue incidence in multiple countries on a large spatial scale. This study addresses the heterogeneity of GDT at smaller spatial scales, assessing its accuracy at the state-level in Mexico and identifying factors that are associated with its accuracy. We used Pearson correlation to estimate the association between GDT and traditional dengue surveillance data for Mexico at the national level and for 17 Mexican states. Nationally, GDT captured approximately 83\% of the variability in reported cases over the 9 study years. The correlation between GDT and reported cases varied from state to state, capturing anywhere from 1\% of the variability in Baja California to 88\% in Chiapas, with higher accuracy in states with higher dengue average annual incidence. A model including annual average maximum temperature, precipitation, and their interaction accounted for 81\% of the variability in GDT accuracy between states. This climate model was the best indicator of GDT accuracy, suggesting that GDT works best in areas with intense transmission, particularly where local climate is well suited for transmission. Internet accessibility (average {\textasciitilde} 36\%) did not appear to affect GDT accuracy. While GDT seems to be a less robust indicator of local transmission in areas of low incidence and unfavorable climate, it may indicate cases among travelers in those areas. Identifying the strengths and limitations of novel surveillance is critical for these types of data to be used to make public health decisions and forecasting models.}

  abstract = {Background: Timely, accurate and accessible antimicrobial susceptibility data are essential for effective clinical and public health responses. In northern Australia, bacterial infection rates are high but resistance to antibiotics is poorly described. HOTspots (amrhotspots.com.au) is a regional, laboratory-based, passive surveillance system that aims to inform clinical management of patients, treatment guidelines and policies. Here we evaluate the utility of this prototype system to end users. Methods and materials: The evaluation was guided by the Centre for Disease Control's framework for evaluating public health surveillance systems. Evidence to assess the system attributes of simplicity, flexibility, acceptability, timeliness, and stability was collected through interviews with clinicians, guideline contributors and policy-makers. Data quality and sensitivity were determined by interviews and an audit of HOTspots data against available antimicrobial susceptibility data. Representativeness was analysed by comparing population coverage of participating and non-participating pathology service providers. Result(s): The system is simple in structure and operation but could be improved by standardising data collection from laboratories. The data management process facilitates system flexibility, but platform limitations are a barrier to the simplicity, flexibility and acceptability of the system. Acceptability was reduced by the inability to support nuanced clinical and public health decision-making, although enhanced by timely data provision. Future challenges to stability include sustainable governance, funding and human resourcing. Data completeness was high and validity good, though could be improved through quality assurance. The system was found to be sensitive, with an average 94.9\% agreement between HOTspots data and local susceptibility data. Three major pathology service providers, who service public and private, hospital and community populations, have contributed data, establishing high quality representativeness of the system. Conclusion(s): HOTspots' strength lies in its provision of timely, representative and accurate antimicrobial susceptibility data to end users in northern Australia. Recommendations to enhance the system include standardising data collection, upgrading the platform and working with end users to build more nuanced clinical and public health decision-making support. Sustainable governance and resourcing are essential to achieving this aim. Successful implementation of HOTspots into regional surveillance activities will innovate the way health services receive and act on changing patterns of antimicrobial resistance.Copyright {\copyright} 2020},

  abstract = {Community rapid response may reduce opioid overdose harms, but is hindered by the lack of timely data. To address this need, we created and evaluated the Michigan system for opioid overdose surveillance (SOS). SOS integrates suspected fatal overdose data from Medical Examiners (MEs), and suspected non-fatal overdoses (proxied by naloxone administration) from the Michigan Emergency Medical Services (EMS) into a web-based dashboard that was developed with stakeholder feedback. Authorised stakeholders can view approximate incident locations and automated spatiotemporal data summaries, while the general public can view county-level summaries. Following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveillance system evaluation guidelines, we assessed simplicity, flexibility, data quality, acceptability, sensitivity, positive value positive (PVP), representativeness, timeliness and stability of SOS. Data are usually integrated into SOS 1-day postincident, and the interface is updated weekly for debugging and new feature addition, suggesting high timeliness, stability and flexibility. Regarding representativeness, SOS data cover 100\% of EMS-based naloxone administrations in Michigan, and receives suspected fatal overdoses from MEs covering 79.1\% of Michigan's population, but misses those receiving naloxone from non-EMS. PVP of the suspected fatal overdose indicator is nearly 80\% across MEs. Because SOS uses pre-existing data, added burden on MEs/EMS is minimal, leading to high acceptability; there are over 300 authorised SOS stakeholders ({\textasciitilde}6 new registrations/week) as of this writing, suggesting high user acceptability. Using a collaborative, cross-sector approach we created a timely opioid overdose surveillance system that is flexible, acceptable, and is reasonably accurate and complete. Lessons learnt can aid other jurisdictions in creating analogous systems.},

The most active spread of the infection occurred in medical organizations, which is associated with defects in clinical diagnosis of measles in the first patients and untimely organization of anti-epidemic measures. When carrying out anti-epidemic measures, almost all indicators of the quality of epidemiological surveillance of measles corresponded to the estimated indicators (except for the proportion of foci without the spread of infection). In order to improve the system of epidemiological surveillance of measles, it is proposed to examine all patients with spot-papular rash, temperature and/or catarrhal phenomena and the absence of vaccination against measles when they enter the hospital.},

Method(s): The description and evaluation of PSAEFI were undertaken using the reported cases of adverse events following immunization with DTwP-Hib vaccine (AEFI-T), during the period from 2002 to 2005, using the Centers for Disease Control methodology. Result(s): The PSAEFI system, which provides national coverage, is designed to standardize practices in cases of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) and to identify highly reactogenic lots of vaccine. The PSAEFI system proved its usefulness, simplicity and flexibility; despite low sensitivity, overestimate the proportion of sever events, but it consistently described AEFI-T, identifying fever, convulsions and hypotonic-hyporesponsive episodes as the most common events. It showed that 49.7\% of AEFI-T occur after the first dose, and that 72.8\% occur within the first six hours after vaccination. It facilitates public health decisions and epidemiological investigations. It is timely, 46.1\% of all AEFI-T being reported within 10 days after vaccination and its completeness ranges from 70 to 90\%, depending on the item evaluated. Conclusion(s): The PSAEFI system proved useful for monitoring DTwP-Hib vaccine safety. We recommended the incorporation of new methodologies, such the use of sentinel cities/hospitals and computerized immunization registries in order to increase its sensitivity.}

Methods: a mixed assessment study was carried out where qualitative and quantitative techniques were combined. The scope of the study included 68 physicians and 76 nurses working at the primary health care level (PHC) of the three areas existing in the territory; the three vice-directors for hygiene and epidemiology, the vaccination program manager and the nurses working in vaccination centers. The three components of the system were evaluated: Structure, Process and Results through a comprehensive methodology. Results: the Structure of the system was evaluated as "definite". However, the process of "good performance" was considered little timely and flexible. The results were assessed as "acceptable" due to non-compliance with the technical standards immunizations. Generally, the system was rated as unsatisfactory. Conclusions: the evaluation of the system identified gaps in performance such as poor user training. It was found that the proper functioning of the processes has assured system activities. It is essential to monitor their attributes in order to timely solve the identified deficiencies.},

  abstract = {For infectious diseases such as highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by the H5N1 virus (A/H5N1 HP), early warning system is essential. Evaluating the sensitivity of surveillance is a necessary step in ensuring an efficient and sustainable system. Stochastic scenario tree modeling was used here to assess the sensitivity of the A/H5N1 HP surveillance system in backyard and free-grazing duck farms in Thailand. The whole surveillance system for disease detection was modeled with all components and the sensitivity of each component and of the overall system was estimated. Scenarios were tested according to selection of high-risk areas, inclusion of components and sampling procedure, were tested. Nationwide passive surveillance (SSC1) and risk-based clinical X-ray (SSC2) showed a similar sensitivity level, with a median sensitivity ratio of 0.96 (95\% CI 0.40-15.00). They both provide higher sensitivity than the X-ray laboratory component (SSC3). With the current surveillance design, the sensitivity of detection of the overall surveillance system when the three components are implemented, was equal to 100\% for a farm level prevalence of 0.05\% and 82\% (95\% CI 71-89\%) for a level of infection of 3 farms. Findings from this study illustrate the usefulness of scenario-tree modeling to document freedom from diseases in developing countries. {\copyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.}

This extended an existing trade suspension of live equids from South Africa to the European Union. In the post-outbreak period ongoing passive and active surveillance, the latter in the form of monthly sentinel surveillance and a stand-alone freedom from disease survey in March 2017, took place. We describe a stochastic scenario tree analysis of these surveillance components for 24 months, starting July 2016, in three distinct geographic areas of the controlled area. Given that AHS was not detected, the probability of being free from AHS was between 98.3\% and 99.8\% assuming that, if it were present, it would have a prevalence of at least one infected animal in 1\% of herds. This high level of freedom probability had been attained in all three areas within the first 9 months of the 2-year period. The primary driver of surveillance outcomes was the passive surveillance component. Active surveillance components contributed minimally ({$<$}0.2\%) to the final probability of freedom. Sensitivity analysis showed that the probability of infected horses showing clinical signs was an important parameter influencing the system surveillance sensitivity. The monthly probability of disease introduction needed to be increased to 20\% and greater to decrease the overall probability of freedom to below 90\%. Current global standards require a 2-year post-incursion period of AHS freedom before re-evaluation of free zone status. Our findings show that the length of this period could be decreased if adequately sensitive surveillance is performed. In order to comply with international standards, active surveillance will remain a component of AHS surveillance in South Africa. Passive surveillance, however, can provide substantial evidence supporting AHS freedom status declarations, and further investment in this surveillance activity would be beneficial.

It is a contagious viral disease which causes death among children globally, with majority occurring in Africa despite availability of effective vaccines. Ghana is currently at the elimination stage and therefore surveillance is critical to ensuring that cases are detected early. We evaluated the measles surveillance system at New Juaben Municipality, Eastern Region from 2014-2018 to determine its performance, usefulness and assess its system attributes. Methods and materials: The system was evaluated using the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention updated guidelines 2001. Stakeholders were interviewed using semi-structured questionnaire. Data from 2014 to 2018 from the District's line list and District Health Information Management System 2 was reviewed and analyzed. Qualitative data analysis was done using direct content analysis approach and quantitative data was analyzed descriptively using Microsoft excel 2013. Results presented in graphs and charts. Result(s): Respondents at all levels had a clear knowledge and understanding of measles, its purpose and objectives of the Surveillance system. The data generated is useful, it is analyzed and used for discussions at meetings. The system had clear simple case definition which made it easy to capture suspected cases. It is integrated into other surveillance system and the introduction of the Rubella vaccine was easily added and adapted which shows its flexibility and during the period under evaluation there has not been any power outages or break downs of computers leading to loss of data which shows the systems stability. The health facilities reported on time to the district, which showed the timeliness and due to adequate reporting it was sensitive enough to detect suspected cases.

  abstract = {Outbreaks of infectious diseases can occur after natural disasters as vital services are disrupted and populations move into evacuation centres. National notifiable disease surveillance may be inadequate in these situations because of resource-consuming disease confirmation or system interruptions. Although syndromic surveillance has been used as an alternative in post-disaster situations, no systematic evaluations of it have been published. We evaluated the ad hoc paper-based syndromic surveillance system implemented in evacuation centres in Ibaraki prefecture after the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami. We assessed the simplicity, acceptability, data quality, timeliness and portability of this system and reviewed its usefulness. We concluded that the system was simple, acceptable, portable and useful. The documentation and monitoring of disease events and trends were useful for developing interventions in evacuation centres and have since been used to improve post-disaster infectious disease and surveillance knowledge in Japan. We believe timeliness was a challenge due to the chain of data transmission and communication passing through an intermediary. Future implementations of this system could consider a more direct chain of data transmission and communication from collectors to analysers. Too few key informant interviewees and the inability to obtain original paper-based data from evacuation centres limited our findings; we conducted this evaluation four years after the response occurred. Future evaluations should be completed closer to when operations cease. The usefulness of the system suggests adopting it in future disasters. A simple, plain-language manual should be developed to improve future employment.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 2008, Africa accounted for 94\% of the cholera cases reported worldwide. Although the World Health Organization currently recommends the oral cholera vaccine in endemic areas for high-risk populations, its use in Sub-Saharan Africa has been limited. Here, we provide the principal results of an evaluation of the cholera surveillance system in the region of Maradi in Niger and an analysis of its data towards identifying high-risk areas for cholera., RESULTS: We evaluated the cholera surveillance data using a standard CDC protocol, through interviews with heads of the system, and a review of cholera data collected between 2006-2009. The surveillance system was found to be sufficiently reliable to be able to utilize the data for the detection of high risk areas for cholera vaccination. Temporal, geographic and socio-demographic analyses of cholera cases indicated that between 2006 and 2009, 433 cholera cases were reported in the Maradi region of Niger. Two deprived neighborhoods of the region's capital city, Bagalam and Yandaka, represented 1\% of the regional population and 21\% of the cholera cases, reaching a yearly incidence rate of 3 per 1000 in 2006 and 2008, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: The results of this evaluation suggest that the reporting sensitivity of the surveillance system is sufficient, to appropriately classify the region as cholera endemic. Additionally, two overcrowded neighborhoods in the regional capital met WHO criteria for consideration for cholera vaccination.}

  abstract = {Background: Though 100\% vaccine-preventable, rabies remains endemic in Ghana. Most rabies outbreaks occur in communities where preventive measures of dog-human transmission are poor. The objectives of the rabies surveillance system in Ghana include early detection of outbreaks, monitoring the spread and progress of outbreaks and determination of high-risk areas for interventions. Due to underreporting, poor surveillance and a weak One-Health approach to surveillance, reports on rabies are often incomplete. We evaluated the rabies surveillance system in Sunyani West District (SWD) to assess whether it is meeting its objectives, assess its system's attributes and usefulness. Methods and materials: We extracted and reviewed rabies data for the period 2014-2018 from health and veterinary records in the SWD. We interviewed key stakeholders to collect data about the operations and attributes of the system using the CDC's Updated Guidelines for Evaluating Public Health Surveillance Systems. We performed summary descriptive statistics on quantitative data and direct content analysis on qualitative data. Result(s): Between 2014-2018, 5.5\% (14/254) of dog bites reported to the health facilities in SWD were captured by the veterinary office from which one outbreak was detected. All veterinary staff at SWD (4/4) were involved in rabies surveillance and had knowledge on case definition. Case investigation forms were easy to complete; requiring less than 10 min. Only two follow-ups at one-week interval were required to update case status. Reporting of suspected cases to the next level was real-time and sample submission to the laboratory was within 24 h. A PVP of 12.8\% (41/320) was recorded at regional level. Against a 70\% vaccination coverage target, the coverage was 5.5\% (national), 8.5\% (regional) and 7.1\% (SWD). Of the cases reviewed, 92.9\% (13/14) had reports with none completely filled. Conclusion(s): The rabies surveillance system is useful. It meets one of its objectives; early detection of outbreaks. It is simple, timely and sensitive but has poor data quality and not acceptable. We recommend refresher training on data reporting by the Veterinary Services Directorate (VSD) and strengthening the One-Health approach to rabies surveillance by VSD and Ghana Health Services.Copyright {\copyright} 2020},

  abstract = {PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES: Prevalence of excessive alcohol use and alcohol-attributable mortality is much higher in New Mexico than in other US states. In 2010, excessive alcohol use cost the state roughly \$2.2 billion. Moreover, age-adjusted deaths from alcohol-related chronic liver disease increased 52.5\% from 14.1 cases in 2010 to 21.5 cases in 2016. In 2017, the New Mexico Department of Health piloted the Recommended Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) Surveillance Indicators for Substance Abuse and Mental Health, using 5 indicators to monitor alcohol use and health consequences. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the alcohol surveillance system implemented in New Mexico to ensure that the system yields useful, timely data that can help create effective public health interventions and that resources required for surveillance are adequate., INTERVENTION APPROACH: CSTE alcohol surveillance system data come from existing national and state-based surveys and vital statistics., EVALUATION METHODS: This evaluation assessed attributes defined in Evaluating Behavioral Health Surveillance Systems and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for evaluating public health surveillance systems. Assessment was informed through data collection, systematic literature review searches, and an interview with the alcohol epidemiologist at New Mexico Department of Health., RESULTS: The CSTE alcohol surveillance system in New Mexico is a useful, stable, and accepted system with good representativeness and population coverage. Data sharing and collaboration between centers within New Mexico Department of Health are well-established, making data access easy and timely. Lastly, the resources required for data collection are accountable and adequate., IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH: The CSTE alcohol surveillance system brings together information (alcohol consumption behaviors and associated morbidity, mortality, and policy-related measures) necessary to show a clear picture of the alcohol effects in New Mexico. This information yields useable, timely data from which the state can monitor trends and develop interventions to reduce the prevalence of alcohol-attributable morbidity and mortality.},

In a comprehensive evaluation we assessed how well the system operates to meet its objectives., METHODS: Surveillance protocols and the national database were reviewed. Data managers at national level, infection control practitioners and ward personnel in hospitals as well as contact persons in LTCFs involved in prevalence data collection were surveyed., RESULTS: The evaluation showed that the system was structurally simple, flexible and accepted by the key partners. On average 87\% of hospitals and 32\% of LTCFs participated in 2004-2008; high level of data completeness was achieved. The data collected described trends in the prevalence of reportable HAIs in Norway and informed policy makers. Local results were used in hospitals to implement targeted infection control measures and to argue for more resources to a greater extent than in LTCFs. Both the use of simplified Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definitions and validity of data seemed problematic as compliance with the standard methodology were reportedly low., CONCLUSIONS: The surveillance system provides important information on selected HAIs in Norway. The system is overall functional and well-established in hospitals, however, requires active promotion in LTCFs. Validity of data needs to be controlled in the participating institutions before reporting to the national level.}

In other low-income countries, trauma system implementation and trauma registries have helped to reduce mortality from injury by up to 35\%. In 2014, we introduced a trauma registry in four hospitals in Maputo serving 18,000 patients yearly. The project has since expanded nationally. This study summarizes the challenges, results, and lessons learned from this large national undertaking., METHODS: Between October 2014-September 2015, we implemented a trauma registry at four hospitals in Maputo. In October 2015, the project began to be expanded nationally. Physicians and allied health professionals at each hospital were trained to implement the registry, and each identified and trained data collectors. We conducted semi-structured interviews with the key stakeholders of this project to identify the challenges, results, and creative solutions implemented for the success of this project., RESULTS: Most participants identified the importance of having a trauma registry and its usefulness in identifying gaps in trauma care. The registry identified that less than 5\% of injured patients arrived by ambulance, which served as evidence for the need for a prehospital system, which the Ministry of Health had already begun implementing. Participants also highlighted how the registry has allowed for a structured clinical approach to patients, ensuring that severely injured patients are identified early. Challenges reported included the high rates of missing data, the difficulty in establishing a streamlined flow of trauma patients within each hospital, and the bureaucratic challenges faced when attempting to improve capacity for trauma care at each hospital by introducing a trauma bay and new technologies. Participants identified the need to improve data completeness, to disseminate the results of the project nationally and internationally, to improve inter-divisional cooperation, and to continue educating health providers on the importance of registries. Participants also identified political instabilities in the region as a potential source of challenge in expanding the project nationally; they also identified the lack of uniform resource allocation and low personnel in many areas, especially rural, as a major burden that would need to be overcome., CONCLUSION: Introduction of a trauma registry system in Mozambique is feasible and necessary. Initial findings provide insight into the nature of traumas seen in Maputo hospitals, but also underscore future challenges, especially in minimizing missing data, utilizing data to develop evidence-based trauma prevention policies, and ensuring the sustainability of these efforts by ensuring continued governmental support, education, and resource allocation. Many of these measures are being undertaken.},

  abstract = {Rooted in the recognition that emerging infectious diseases occur at the interface of human, animal, and ecosystem health, the Southern African Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance (SACIDS) initiative aims to promote a trans-sectoral approach to address better infectious disease risk management in five countries of the Southern African Development Community. Nine years after SACIDS' inception, this study aimed to evaluate the program by applying a One Health (OH) evaluation framework developed by the Network for Evaluation of One Health (NEOH). The evaluation included a description of the context and the initiative, illustration of the theory of change, identification of outputs and outcomes, and assessment of the One Healthness. The latter is the sum of characteristics that defines an integrated approach and includes OH thinking, OH planning, OH working, sharing infrastructure, learning infrastructure, and systemic organization. The protocols made available by NEOH were used to develop data collection protocols and identify the study design. The framework relies on a mixed methods approach by combining a descriptive and qualitative assessment with a semi-quantitative evaluation (scoring). Data for the analysis were gathered during a document review, in group and individual interviews and in an online survey. Operational aspects (i.e., OH thinking, planning, and working) were found to be balanced overall with the highest score in the planning dimension, whereas the infrastructure (learning infrastructure, systemic organization, and sharing infrastructure) was high for the first two dimensions, but low for sharing. The OH index calculated was 0.359, and the OH ratio calculated was 1.495. The program was praised for its great innovative energy in a difficult landscape dominated by poor infrastructure and its ability to create awareness for OH and enthuse people for the concept; training of people and networking. Shortcomings were identified regarding the balance of contributions, funds and activities across member countries in the South, lack of data sharing, unequal allocation of resources, top-down management structures, and limited horizontal collaboration. Despite these challenges, SACIDS is perceived to be an effective agent in tackling infectious diseases in an integrated manner.},

  abstract = {National-level evaluations may fail to identify capacity improvements for detecting and responding to outbreaks which begin and are first detected at the local level. In response to this issue, we conducted a field-based assessment of the malaria outbreak surveillance system in Mashonaland East, Zimbabwe. We visited eleven clinics in Mudzi and Goromonzi districts. Twenty-one interviews were conducted with key informants from the provincial (n=2), district (n=7), and clinic (n=12) levels. Interviews focused on surveillance system activities, preparedness, data quality, timeliness, stability, and usefulness. Main themes were captured utilising standard qualitative data analysis techniques. While the surveillance system detects malaria outbreaks at all levels, we identified several gaps. Clinics experience barriers to timely and reliable reporting of outbreaks to the district level and staff cross-training. Stability of resources, including transportation (33\% of informants, n=7) and staff capacity (48\% of informants, n=10), presented barriers. Strengthening these surveillance barriers may improve staff readiness to detect malaria outbreaks, resulting in timelier outbreak response and a reduction in malaria outbreaks, cases, and deaths. By focusing at the local level, our assessment approach provides a framework for identifying and addressing gaps that may be overlooked when utilising tools that evaluate surveillance capacity at the national level.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: According to the National Center for Health Statistics, Kentucky had the third highest drug overdose fatality rate in the nation in 2015 at 29.9 drug overdose fatalities per 100 000 population., OBJECTIVE: The elevated drug overdose fatality rate necessitated the development and implementation of a comprehensive multisource drug overdose fatality surveillance system (DOFSS)., METHODS: DOFSS stakeholder work group members and data sources were identified, and memorandums of understanding were established. The following data sources were used to establish DOFSS: (1) death certificates; (2) autopsy reports; (3) toxicology result reports; (4) coroner reports; and (5) Kentucky All Schedule Prescription Electronic Reporting (KASPER) (prescription drug monitoring programme) data. Drug overdose poisonings were defined using Injury Surveillance Workgroup 7 definitions. Analyses were performed to investigate possible drug overdose-related health disparities for disabled drug overdose decedents and to characterise gabapentin in drug overdose deaths., RESULTS: DOFSS identified 2106 drug overdose poisoning fatalities in Kentucky for 2013-2014. Identification of specific drugs involved in drug overdose deaths increased from 75.8\% using a single data source to 97.5\% using multiple data sources. Disabled drug overdose decedents were significantly more likely to have an active prescription for drugs identified in their system compared with the non-disabled drug overdose decedents. Toxicology data showed increased gabapentin involvement in drug overdose deaths from 2.9\% in 2013 to 17\% in 2014. Alprazolam was found most often in combination with gabapentin (41\%), along with various other benzodiazepines and prescription opioids., CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive multisource DOFSS improved drug overdose fatality surveillance by increasing completeness of data and data quality. DOFSS is a model that can be considered by other states to enhance their efforts in tracking drug overdose fatalities, identifying new and emerging trends, and informing policies and best practices, to address and reduce drug overdoses.

High quality fetal death certificate data are necessary for states to effectively address preventable fetal deaths. We evaluated completeness of detection of fetal deaths among Wyoming residents that occur out-of-state, quality of cause-of-death data, and timeliness of Wyoming fetal death certificate registration during 2006-2013. Description The numbers of out-of-state fetal deaths among Wyoming residents recorded by Wyoming surveillance and reported by the National Vital Statistics System were compared. Quality of cause-of-death data was assessed by calculating percentage of fetal death certificates completed in Wyoming with ill-defined, unknown, or missing cause-of-death entries. Timeliness was determined using the time between the fetal death and filing of the fetal death certificate with the Wyoming Department of Health Vital Statistics Service. Assessment Wyoming surveillance detected none of the 76 out-of-state fetal deaths among Wyoming residents reported by the National Vital Statistics System. Among 263 fetal death certificates completed in Wyoming and collected by Wyoming surveillance, 108 (41\%) contained ill-defined, unknown, or missing cause-of-death entries. Median duration between the fetal death and filing with the Wyoming Vital Statistics Service was 33 days. Conclusion Wyoming fetal mortality surveillance is limited by failure to register out-of-state fetal deaths among residents, poor quality of cause-of-death data, and lack of timeliness. Strategies to improve surveillance include automating interjurisdictional sharing of fetal death data, certifier education, and electronic fetal death registration.},

Anonymised data on RSV infections has been collected since 1990 in Sweden. No evaluation of Swedish RSV surveillance or use of laboratory testing had previously been performed., OBJECTIVES: Swedish RSV data and methods used for RSV laboratory testing and reporting were evaluated in order to improve RSV surveillance in a forthcoming vaccine era., STUDY DESIGN: RSV data obtained in Sweden 2015-2016 were reviewed. Data on methods used for the RSV laboratory detection and reporting were collected via on-line questionnaires submitted to laboratories (n=26) and clinics (n=4) known to perform virological testing. Swedish Quality Control Program reports from 2013 to 2015 on the performance of RSV testing were also evaluated., RESULTS: Over 60\% of RSV infections were diagnosed in children under 5 years (1917/2925), but infections were also common in those 65 years and older (n=607). Two laboratories limited RSV testing to children only. RSV NPT was utilised in eight clinics; four participated in RSV surveillance. RSV NPTs evaluated could only detect 50\% of RSV positive samples. Reporting was complete and timely, but took too much time (18min/week/laboratory)., CONCLUSIONS: Although most common in children, RSV infections are also common in the elderly, and testing should not be limited to children only. The poor performance of RSV NPT and importance of confirming results should be communicated to all relevant laboratories and clinics. All clinics should be encouraged to participate in surveillance. Automated case-based reporting should be considered. Copyright {\copyright} 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Empirical analyses founded on sound economic principles are essential in advising policy makers on the efficiency of resource use for disease mitigation. Surveillance and intervention are resource-using activities directed at mitigation. Surveillance helps to offset negative disease effects by promoting successful intervention. Intervention is the process of implementing measures (e.g. vaccination or medication) to reduce or remove a hazard in a population. The scale and ratios in which the two are combined affect the efficiency of mitigation, its costs, benefits, and thus net effect on society's well-being. The Swiss national mitigation programme for bluetongue virus serotype 8 was used as case study to investigate the economic efficiency of mitigation. In 2008, Switzerland implemented a vaccination programme to avoid and reduce disease and infection in its ruminant population. To monitor the vaccination programme and the vector dynamics, a surveillance system consisting of serological and entomological surveillance was established. Retrospective analyses for the years 2008-2009 and prospective analyses for the years 2010-2012 were conducted to investigate if the mitigation programme was economically beneficial. In the retrospective analysis, the implemented programme (=comparative scenario) was compared to a hypothesised baseline scenario of voluntary vaccination and surveillance. In the prospective analysis, the comparative scenario assumed to continue was compared to two baseline scenarios: one of voluntary vaccination combined with surveillance and one of no vaccination combined with surveillance. For each scenario, monetary surveillance, intervention and disease costs were calculated. The comparison of baseline and comparative scenarios yielded estimates for the total benefit (=disease costs avoided), margin over intervention cost and the net value of the programme. For 2008-2009, in aggregate, the mean biannual total benefit was 17.46 m Swiss francs (CHF) (1CHF=0.66 Euro at the time of analysis) and the mean net benefit after subtraction of the intervention and surveillance cost was 3.95 m CHF. For the three years 2010-2012, overall net costs were estimated at 12.93 m and 8.11 m CHF, respectively, for comparison of the implemented mitigation programme with the two baseline scenarios. It was concluded that the surveillance and intervention programme implemented in 2008-2009 was economically beneficial, while its continuation in the same form in 2010-2012 would produce net costs. These costs were due to the mean intervention cost remaining constant at a level of approximately 11 m CHF per year while the mean total benefit would be gradually reduced in 2010-2012 due to the reduced occurrence of disease in a fully vaccinated population.}

  abstract = {The aim of the project was to apply cost-effectiveness analysis to the economic appraisal of avian influenza virus (AIV) surveillance, using the implemented surveillance programme in Switzerland as a case study. First a qualitative risk assessment approach was used to assess the expected impact of surveillance on the transmission and spread of AIV. The effectiveness of surveillance was expressed as the difference in defined probabilities between a scenario with surveillance and a scenario without surveillance. The following probabilities were modelled (i) transmission of highly pathogenic AIV (HPAIV) from wild birds to poultry, (ii) mutation from low pathogenic AIV (LPAIV) into HPAIV in poultry, and (iii) transmission of HPAIV to other poultry holdings given a primary outbreak. The cost-effectiveness ratio was defined conventionally as the difference in surveillance costs ({$\Delta$}C) divided by the change in probability ({$\Delta$}P), the technical objective, on the presumption that surveillance diminishes the respective probabilities. However, results indicated that surveillance in both wild birds and poultry was not expected to change the probabilities of primary and secondary AIV outbreaks in Switzerland. The overall surveillance costs incurred were estimated at 31,000 Euro/year, which, to be a rational investment of resources, must still reflect the value policy makers attribute to other benefits from having surveillance (e.g. peace of mind). The advantage of the approach adopted is that it is practical, transparent, and thus able to clarify for policy makers the key variables to be taken into account when evaluating the economic efficiency of resources invested in surveillance, prevention and intervention to exclude AIV.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In Germany, surveillance for infectious disease outbreaks is integrated into an electronic surveillance system. For 2007, the national surveillance database contains case-based information on 201,224 norovirus cases, three-quarters of which are linked to outbreaks. We evaluated the data quality of the national database in reflecting nosocomial norovirus outbreak (NNO) data available in 19 Hessian local public health authorities (LPHAs) and the influence of differences between LPHA's follow-up procedures for laboratory notifications of Norovirus positive stool samples on outbreak underascertainment., METHODS: Data on NNO beginning in 2007 and notified to the 19 LPHAs were extracted from the national database, investigated regarding internal validity and compared to data collected from LPHAs for a study on NNO control. LPHAs were questioned whether they routinely contacted all persons for whom a laboratory diagnosis of norovirus infection was notified. The number of outbreaks per 1,000 hospital beds and the number of cases within NNOs for acute care and rehabilitation hospitals were compared between counties with and without complete follow-up., RESULTS: The national database contained information on 155 NNOs, including 3,115 cases. Cases were missed in the national database in 58 (37\%) of the outbreaks. Information on hospitalisation was incorrect for an estimated 47\% of NNO cases. Information on county of infection was incorrect for 24\% (199/820) of cases being forwarded between LPHAs for data entry. Reported NNO incidence and number of NNO cases in acute care hospitals was higher in counties with complete follow-up (incidence-rate ratio (IRR) 2.7, 95\% CI 1.4-5.7, p-value 0.002 and IRR 2.1, 95\% CI 1.9-2.4, p-value 0.001, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: Many NNOs are not notified by hospitals and differences in LPHA procedures have an impact on the number of outbreaks captured in the surveillance system. Forwarding of case-by-case data on Norovirus outbreak cases from the local to the state and national level should not be required.}

We conducted a qualitative inquiry into the current state of policy and programs for integrated AMR/AMU surveillance using explicit and tacit knowledge. To assess the "messy" state of public health surveillance program development, we synthesized recommendations from previous reports by the National Collaborating Centre for Infectious Diseases and the Canadian Council of Chief Veterinary Officers; conducted an environmental scan to find all federal, provincial, and territorial AMR/AMU surveillance programs in Canada; and conducted semi-structured interviews with Canadian subject matter experts. To integrate evidence from these different sources we adapted two published tools to create a new evaluation matrix, deriving 36 components of the ideal integrated AMR/AMU surveillance system. Our two-way matrix tool allowed us to examine seven common, foundational elements of sustainable programs for each component, and assign a stage of development/sustainability ranking for each component according to the matrix definitions. Our adaptable novel tool allowed for granular and repeatable assessment of the many components of a complex surveillance system. The assessment proved robust and exacting to ensure transparency in our methods and results. The matrix allows flexible assignment of program components based on program principles, and stages can be adapted to evaluate any aspect of an AMR/AMU surveillance or other multi-faceted, multi-jurisdictional system. Future refinement should include an assessment of the scope of surveillance components. Copyright {\copyright} 2021 Haworth-Brockman, Saxinger, Miazga-Rodriguez, Wierzbowski and Otto.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evaluating the features and performance of health information systems can serve to strengthen the systems themselves as well as to guide other organizations in the process of designing and implementing surveillance tools. We adapted an evaluation framework in order to assess electronic immunization data collection systems, and applied it in two Ontario public health units., METHODS: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Guidelines for Evaluating Public Health Surveillance Systems are broad in nature and serve as an organizational tool to guide the development of comprehensive evaluation materials. Based on these Guidelines, and informed by other evaluation resources and input from stakeholders in the public health community, we applied an evaluation framework to two examples of immunization data collection and examined several system attributes: simplicity, flexibility, data quality, timeliness, and acceptability. Data collection approaches included key informant interviews, logic and completeness assessments, client surveys, and on-site observations., RESULTS: Both evaluated systems allow high-quality immunization data to be collected, analyzed, and applied in a rapid fashion. However, neither system is currently able to link to other providers' immunization data or provincial data sources, limiting the comprehensiveness of coverage assessments. We recommended that both organizations explore possibilities for external data linkage and collaborate with other jurisdictions to promote a provincial immunization repository or data sharing platform., CONCLUSIONS: Electronic systems such as the ones described in this paper allow immunization data to be collected, analyzed, and applied in a rapid fashion, and represent the infostructure required to establish a population-based immunization registry, critical for comprehensively assessing vaccine coverage.}

METHODS: 481 cases were analyzed by ACCESS2002 and Excel 2002. RESULTS: A total of 481 cases were reported in children under 15 years old in 1995-2010. The reported incidence of AFP was 1.25-2.47 per 100 000. The regionable distribution is sporadic. All indicators of surveillance were improved year by year and finally reached the goal of zero-polio in 2000. CONCLUSION: High proportion of AFP cases tended to be younger children. The susceptible population still existed. 11 counties had no reported cases in these 16 years. The rate of first clinical report rate was 42.83\%. It showed that the management of AFP and Expanded Planned Immunization (EPI) work in rural counties should be strengthened. The vaccination rate should be improved continuously. The eradication of poliomyelitis has made both social and economical benefits and the surveillance could provide the data and proof.}

  abstract = {Surveillance systems of exotic infectious diseases aim to ensure transparency about the country-specific animal disease situation (i.e. demonstrate disease freedom) and to identify any introductions. In a context of decreasing resources, evaluation of surveillance efficiency is essential to help stakeholders make relevant decisions about prioritization of measures and funding allocation. This study evaluated the efficiency (sensitivity related to cost) of the French bovine brucellosis surveillance system using stochastic scenario tree models. Cattle herds were categorized into three risk groups based on the annual number of purchases, given that trading is considered as the main route of brucellosis introduction in cattle herds. The sensitivity in detecting the disease and the costs of the current surveillance system, which includes clinical (abortion) surveillance, programmed serological testing and introduction controls, were compared to those of 19 alternative surveillance scenarios. Surveillance costs included veterinary fees and laboratory analyses. The sensitivity over a year of the current surveillance system was predicted to be 91+/-7\% at a design prevalence of 0.01\% for a total cost of 14.9+/-1.8 million . Several alternative surveillance scenarios, based on clinical surveillance and random or risk-based serological screening in a sample (20\%) of the population, were predicted to be at least as sensitive but for a lower cost. Such changes would reduce whole surveillance costs by 20 to 61\% annually, and the costs for farmers only would be decreased from about 12.0 million  presently to 5.3-9.0 million  (i.e. 25-56\% decrease). Besides, fostering the evolution of the surveillance system in one of these directions would be in agreement with the European regulations and farmers perceptions on brucellosis risk and surveillance.Copyright {\copyright} 2017 Henaux, Calavas.

Methods: Analyzed materials such as situation of current surveillance system, reported cases from 2006 to 2009, situation of pilot surveillance and VCT, etc. Results: The AIDS surveillance network was improved step by step. Detected cases and reported cases were both increasing greatly, respectively with year rate of 30.65\% and 36.06\%. Sexual intercourse (both heterosexual and homosexual) as the major route of HIV transmission became more and more important yearly, while drug-injector's rate declined significantly (P{$<$}0.01). The positive rate of detected samples from hospital and VCT increased yearly, while that from detained population declined significantly (P{$<$}0.01). Two third of reported cases were past infection, 60.61\% of AIDS samples were from hospital. Medians of positive rates of sentinel surveillance drug-injectors, MSM, CSW were 5.25\%, 9.61\% and 0.43\%. Positive rate of VCT samples was 1.78\%. Conclusion: With the development of AIDS surveillance system, larger past infection population is detected. Surveillance rate of pilot is higher. Hospital becomes the main window to detect HIV/AIDS. VCT is an important way to access high-risk groups and detect positive case on the early time.},

  abstract = {Research and policy processes in many fields, such as sustainability and health, are increasingly relying on transdisciplinary cooperation among a multitude of governmental, nongovernmental, and private actors from local to global levels. In the absence of hierarchical chains of command, multistakeholder governance may accommodate conflicting or diverse interests and facilitate collective action, but its effectiveness depends on its capacity to integrate systems, transformation, and target knowledge. Approaches to foster such governance are nascent and quickly evolving, and methodological standards to facilitate comparison and learning from best practice are needed. However, there is currently no evaluation approach that (i) comprehensively assesses the capacity for knowledge integration in multistakeholder governance, (ii) draws on the best available knowledge that is being developed in various fields, and (iii) combines a systematic and transferable methodological design with pragmatic feasibility. We brought together 20 experts from institutions in nine countries, all working on evaluation approaches for collaborative science--policy initiatives. In a synthesis process that included a 2-day workshop and follow-up work among a core group of participants, we developed a tool for evaluating knowledge integration capacity in multistakeholder governance (EVOLvINC). Its 23 indicators incorporate previously defined criteria and components of transdisciplinary evaluations into a single, comprehensive framework that operationalizes the capacity for integrating systems, target, and transformation knowledge during an initiative's (a) design and planning processes at the policy formulation stage, (b) organization and working processes at the implementation stage, and (c) sharing and learning processes at the evaluation stage of the policy cycle. EVOLvINC is (i) implemented through a questionnaire, (ii) builds on established indicators where possible, (iii) offers a consistent and transparent semiquantitative scoring and aggregation algorithm, and (iv) uses spider diagrams for visualizing results. The tool builds on experience and expertise from both the northern and southern hemispheres and was empirically validated with seven science--policy initiatives in six African and Asian countries. As a generalized framework, EVOLvINC thus enables a structured reflection on the capacity of multistakeholder governance processes to foster knowledge integration. Its emphasis on dialog and exploration allows adaptation to contextual specificities, highlights relative strengths and weaknesses, and suggests avenues for shaping multistakeholder governance toward mutual learning, capacity building, and strengthened networks. The validation suggests that the adaptive capacity of multistakeholder governance could be best enhanced by considering systems characteristics at the policy formulation stage and fostering adaptive and generic learning at the evaluation stage of the policy cycle.},

  abstract = {Tackling complex public health challenges requires integrated approaches to health, such as One Health (OH). A key element of these approaches is the integration of knowledge across sectors, disciplines and stakeholders. It is not yet clear which elements of knowledge integration need endorsement to achieve best outcomes. This paper assesses 15 OH initiatives in 16 African, Asian and European countries to identify opportunities to improve knowledge integration and to investigate geographic influences on knowledge integration capacities. Two related evaluation tools, both relying on semi-quantitative questionnaires, were applied to two sets of case studies. In one tool, the questions relate to operations and infrastructure, while the other assigns questions to the three phases of "design," "implementation," and "evaluation" of the project life cycle. In both, the question scores are aggregated using medians. For analysis, extreme values were identified to highlight strengths and weaknesses. Seven initiatives were assessed by a single evaluator external to the initiative, and the other eight initiatives were jointly assessed by several internal and external evaluators. The knowledge integration capacity was greatest during the project implementation stage, and lowest during the evaluation stage. The main weaknesses pointing towards concrete potential for improvement were identified to be a lack of consideration of systemic characteristics, missing engagement of external stakeholders and poor bridging of knowledge, amplified by the absence of opportunities to learn and evolve in a collective process. Most users were unfamiliar with the systems approach to evaluation and found the use of the tools challenging, but they appreciated the new perspective and saw benefits in the ensuing reflections. We conclude that systems thinking and associated practises for OH require not only specific education in OH core competencies, but also methodological and institutional measures to endorse broad participation. To facilitate meta-analyses and generic improvement of integrated approaches to health we suggest including knowledge integration processes as elements to report according to the COHERE guidelines.

The following themes were separated into five topical FGDs to get participants' opinions on the merits, flaws, and recommendations of the NSSC at PoE: (1) health declaration policies; (2) tools; (3) persons and commodities quarantine policies; (4) interagency cooperation; and (5) laboratory management systems. Overall, there was agreement among workshop participants that the NSSC operated efficiently and effectively at the PoE level. The system was deemed appropriate for the task at hand and capable of quick adjustment to the rapidly changing COVID-19 environment. While the majority of participants felt that the system was sufficient to identify and control low- and medium-level case numbers as well as any associated local outbreaks, its ability to handle high incidence over extended periods of time was questioned as this may have left the system as a whole overworked and understaffed. This was the first IAR to assess a national monitoring system during the COVID-19 pandemic using the WHO's COVID-specific methodology. Overall, it was determined that the COVID-19 surveillance system at PoE level in Vietnam was successful in preventing the importation of numerous cases in 2020. However, a long period of high incidence may have just put too much strain on the system. Lessons learned included the necessity of strengthening emergency preparation, improving procurement procedures, and establishing clear leadership early. Given the lengthy and unpredictable nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, they advise all nations to think about periodically evaluating their monitoring system at the PoE level using suitable techniques as the WHO IAR tool.},

National surveillance data were analysed using dot maps to detect clusters of AFP cases with high-risk factors for poliomyelitis. The surveillance system and vaccine coverage were assessed during field investigations. Four clusters of AFP cases were identified, but no poliomyelitis cases. Programmatic failures in the identified high-risk areas included low vaccination rates, poor stool specimen collection and inadequate AFP surveillance. Programme strategies were implemented to correct the identified failures. Use of this methodology provides strong evidence consistent with the absence of wild poliovirus in China.},

Our hospital uses real-time disease surveillance systems (based on daily online reporting of staff medical leave details) with alerts from the Infection Control Unit for early detection of staff infectious disease clusters. We evaluate our current system's performance in detecting acute respiratory infection (ARI) clusters. Method(s): All staff sicknesses due to ARIs and ARI clusters from January 2014 to December 2015 were reviewed, and current thresholds for ARI cluster detection evaluated. To assess data completeness, we compared our data with official records submitted to the hospital's human resource (HR) department. Result(s): The overall completeness of the surveillance data was 77\%. Over the study period, 20\% of ARI medical records were submitted 1-2 weeks after disease occurrence. Hence, only 62\% of ARI medical records were available for real-time surveillance. Using our current cluster detection thresholds of {$>$}=3 ARI cases for small wards and {$>$}=6 cases for large wards, 128 ARI clusters had occurred between January 2014 and December 2015. Of these, 32 were clusters that progressed and required interventions to reduce further transmission. Our system detected 14 such clusters, giving a sensitivity of 43.8\% and a specificity of 79.2\%. The positive predictive value was 41.2\%. Discussion \& Conclusion(s): Our surveillance system is useful for identifying staff ARI clusters for early intervention. Further enhancements to improve cluster detection include integrating the system with the hospital's HR database, providing mobile app platforms to facilitate reporting, and regularly reminding staff about timely and accurate reporting.},

  abstract = {The information provided by animal-health surveillance helps to reduce the impact of animal diseases. The widespread movement of animals and their products around the world results in an increasing risk that disease will spread. There is, therefore, a need for exchange between countries of comparable information about disease incidence; the exchange must be based on a common understanding of surveillance approaches and how surveillance systems are designed and implemented. Establishing agreed-upon definitions of surveillance terms would be a first step in achieving this standardisation, and will enhance transparency and confidence. To this end, a workshop was held with the aim of agreeing upon key terms and concepts for animal-health surveillance. In this paper, we describe the methods used at the workshop and summarise the discussions. A complete list of all the proposed definitions including lists of characteristics that can be used to describe surveillance activities and attributes for evaluation of surveillance is available in the workshop report (available at http://www.defra.gov.uk/ahvla-en/disease-control/surveillance/icahs-workshop/). Some important issues were highlighted during these discussions; of particular note was the importance of economic efficiency as an evaluation attribute. Some remaining inconsistencies in the proposed use of terms are highlighted (including the definition of 'risk-based surveillance' and the use of the term 'event-based surveillance').

Effective chronic disease surveillance can help monitor disease trends, evaluate public policy, prioritize resource allocation, and guide program planning, evaluation, and research. Although chronic disease surveillance is being conducted in the USAPI, no recently published capacity assessments for chronic disease surveillance are available. The objective of this study was to assess the quality of existing USAPI chronic disease data sources and identify jurisdictional capacity for chronic disease surveillance. The assessment included a chronic disease data source inventory, literature review, and review of surveillance documentation available from the web or through individual jurisdictions. We used the World Health Organization's Health Metric Network Framework to assess data source quality and to identify jurisdictional capacity. Results showed that USAPI data sources are generally aligned with widely accepted chronic disease surveillance indicators and use standardized data collection methodology to measure chronic disease behavioral risks, preventive practices, illness, and death. However, all jurisdictions need to strengthen chronic disease surveillance through continued assessment and expanded support for valid and reliable data collection, analysis and reporting, dissemination, and integration among population-based and institution-based data sources. For sustained improvement, we recommend investment and technical assistance in support of a chronic disease surveillance system that integrates population-based and institution-based data sources. An integrated strategy that bridges and links USAPI data sources can support evidence-based policy and population health interventions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A critical challenge in the health sector in developing countries is to ensure the quality and effectiveness of surveillance and public health response in an environment of decentralization. In Georgia, a country where there has been extensive decentralization of public health responsibilities over the last decade, an intervention was recently piloted to strengthen district-level local vaccine-preventable disease surveillance and response activities through improved capacity to analyze and use routinely collected data. The purpose of the study is 1) to assess the effectiveness of the intervention on motivation and perceived capacity to analyze and use information at the district-level, and 2) to assess the role that individual- and system-level factors play in influencing the effectiveness of the intervention., METHODS: A pre-post quasi-experimental research design is used for the quantitative evaluation. Data come from a baseline and two follow-up surveys of district-level health staff in 12 intervention and 3 control Center of Public Health (CPH) offices. These data were supplemented by record reviews in CPH offices as well as focus group discussions among CPH and health facility staff., RESULTS: The results of the study suggest that a number of expected improvements in perceived data availability and analysis occurred following the implementation of the intervention package, and that these improvements in analysis could be attributable to the intervention package. However, the study results also suggest that there exist several health systems barriers that constrained the effectiveness of the intervention in influencing the availability of data, analysis and response., CONCLUSION: To strengthen surveillance and response systems in Georgia, as well as in other countries, donor, governments, and other stakeholders should consider how health systems factors influence investments to improve the availability of data, analysis, and response. Linking the intervention to broader health sector reforms in management processes and organizational culture will be critical to ensure that efforts designed to promote evidence-based decision-making are successful, especially as they are scaled up to the national level.},

  abstract = {Monitoring and evaluation are essential components of all programmes to improve maternal and perinatal health and to ensure that programme effects and value can be documented. A plan for monitoring and evaluation should be done when programmes are being designed and at the start of implementation, not after implementation has commenced. Monitoring and evaluation are two distinct, essential programme activities, which are linked, but have different purposes. Monitoring is the routine and continuous tracking of performance to provide information on ongoing progress, while evaluation is an objective assessment that determines achievement of objectives. A wide range of indicators has been formulated to measure the effect of programme interventions on maternal and perinatal health. Selection of indicators should take into account the programme activities, existence of current data collection systems, human resources and cost. The indicators selected should include a mix of process and outcome measures. Four essential tools that can be used as a basis for monitoring and evaluation of programmes are discussed: theory of change, logical frameworks, evaluation criteria and a framework for evaluation. Managing an evaluation is a complex process and requires allocation of adequate time, funding and expertise. Country level investment is required for vital registration and health information systems with r eal-time monitoring to improve accountability and provide locally relevant information for action.},

The need for the collection of geospatial data to monitor the health impact of rapid social-environmental and economic changes occurring in these countries is being increasingly recognized. Rigorous accuracy assessment of such geospatial data is required to enable error estimation, and ultimately, data utility for exploring population health. This research outlines findings from a field-based evaluation exercise of the SOMAARTH DDESS geospatial-health platform. Participatory-based mixed methods have been employed within Palwal-India to capture villager perspectives on built infrastructure across 51 villages. This study, conducted in 2013, included an assessment of data element position and attribute accuracy undertaken in six villages, documenting mapping errors and land parcel changes. Descriptive analyses of 5.1\% (n = 455) of land parcels highlighted some discrepancies in position (6.4\%) and attribute (4.2\%) accuracy, and land parcel changes (17.4\%). Furthermore, the evaluation led to a refinement of the existing geospatial health platform incorporating ground-truthed reflections from the participatory field exercise. The evaluation of geospatial data accuracies contributes to understandings on global public health surveillance systems, outlining the need to systematically consider assessment of environmental features in relation to lifestyle-related diseases.},

We assessed system components, interviewed NYC Health Department staff, and analyzed 2010 to 2012 death records., RESULTS: Despite widespread disruptions, NYC's EDRS was stable and collected timely mortality data that were adapted to provide storm surveillance with minimal additional resources. Direct-injury fatalities and trends in excess all-cause mortality were rapidly identified, providing useful information for response; however, the time and burden of establishing reports, adapting the system, and identifying indirect deaths limited surveillance., CONCLUSIONS: The NYC Health Department successfully adapted its EDRS for near real-time disaster-related mortality surveillance. Retrospective assessment of deaths, advanced methods for case identification and analysis, standardized reports, and system enhancements will further improve surveillance. Local, state, and federal partners would benefit from partnering with vital records to develop EDRSs for surveillance and to promote ongoing evaluation.},

  abstract = {National birth registration guidelines were revised in 2003 to improve data quality; however, few studies have evaluated the impact on local jurisdictions and their data users. In New York City (NYC), approximately 125,000 births are registered annually with the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, and data are used routinely by the department's maternal and child health (MCH) programs. In order to better meet MCH program needs, we used Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines to assess birth data usefulness, simplicity, data quality, timeliness and representativeness. We interviewed birth registration and MCH program staff, reviewed a 2009 survey of birth registrars (n = 39), and analyzed 2008-2011 birth records for timeliness and completeness (n = 502,274). Thirteen MCH programs use birth registration data for eligibility determination, needs assessment, program evaluation, and surveillance. Demographic variables are used frequently, nearly 100 \% complete, and considered the gold standard by programs; in contrast, medical variables' use and validity varies widely. Seventy-seven percent of surveyed birth registrars reported {$>$}=1 problematic items in the system; 64.1 \% requested further training. During 2008-2011, the median interval between birth and registration was 5 days (range 0-260 days); 11/13 programs were satisfied with timeliness. The NYC birth registration system provides local MCH programs useful, timely, and representative data. However, some medical items are difficult to collect, of low quality, and rarely used. We recommend enhancing training for birth registrars, continuing quality improvement efforts, increasing collaboration with program users, and removing consistently low-quality and low-use variables.}

Three hundred seventeen patients who were clinically diagnosed with urethritis, cervicitis, or gonorrhea were enrolled. N. gonorrhoeae infection was detected by urine-based PCR. A questionnaire was mailed to healthcare providers who potentially see patients with gonorrhea in the Tainan region., RESULTS: Forty-eight N. gonorrhoeae-positive subjects were identified from the sentinel surveillance, and none of these gonorrhea cases were notified to the NGNDS by their healthcare providers. During the study period, there were 67 notified cases in the NGNDS, depicting an underestimation of at least 42\% for this epidemic. Of the 16 healthcare providers who had seen cases in the past 3 months, only seven (43.8\%) reported that they notified the authorities and only 23 (32\%) of 71 cases were reported. 'Not collecting a specimen' and 'afraid of the invasion of patient privacy by the authorities' were the main reasons for the lack of notification., CONCLUSIONS: The underreporting of gonorrhea identified in this pilot is substantial. An overhaul of Taiwan's NGNDS that streamlines the reporting procedures and the requirement for laboratory confirmation, along with a continuing medical education program is warranted.},

Methods: Collected TB related records registered from outpatient department, inpatient department, laboratory, radiology, pathology and prevention department in all medical institutions for the qualification of TB diagnosis and treatment (that is, the ability to perform X-ray chest examination). The missing report rate was calculated by comparing above records with data from national infectious disease reporting system; the under-registration rate was calculated by comparing diagnosis information from designated TB institutions with data from the TB surveillance system. Results: 2 322 suspected and diagnosed cases of TB were treated in medical institutions of Nanshan district in 2016. 16 cases of TB were failed to report and the total missing report rate was 0.69\%. The missing report rate of designated TB institutions, public medical institutions and private medical institutions was 0.79\% (6/760), 1.72\% (37/2 151) and 38.10\% (24/63), respectively; 692 diagnosed cases of TB were found in medical institutions of Nanshan district, of which 513 cases were reported and registered, 179 cases were missed, and the under-registration rate was 25.87\%. The primary reason for the under-registration is that the patients choose to go to Shenzhen Tuberculosis Hospital - The Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen for treatment. Conclusions: All kinds of medical institutions in Nanshan district were missing reports, so the process of card reporting in medical institutions should be standardized and the training of medical staff should be strengthened to improve the quality of tuberculosis reporting. Under-registration rate was higher in this area, so effective measures should be taken to reduce leakage rate.},

In Ethiopia, 20 diseases and conditions are selected to be included in routine surveillance that reported immediately or weekly. Rabies is among immediately reportable disease. This study aims to evaluate the existing surveillance system of rabies in Burayu Town, Oromiya regional state. Methods: this surveillance system evaluation was conducted in Burayu Town, Oromiya region by cross-sectional study design. Data was collected from Burayu Health Office, three Health centers, and five Health Posts using standard questioner prepared for public health surveillance system evaluation from January 15-30, 2019. Data were analyzed by MS. Excel. Results: Burayu town has 302,543 population; all are at risk of rabies. The rabies surveillance system is being conducted regularly and consistently in the town. It captured 452 cases over the last four and half years, among them 267 (59.1\%) were confirmed to be positive by laboratory investigation. It was useful, flexible, simple, sensitive, and stable. However, resources are poor, supervision and feedback are also intermittent and not regular. Epidemic preparedness and response team is not established at health facilities and planning for the surveillance is not practiced. Conclusion: the surveillance system is functioning persistently, but regular supervision and feedback, availing case definitions and guidelines should be ameliorated. A written plan preparation by health facilities regarding the surveillance system, document keeping, resource planning and data analysis requires improvement. {\copyright} Fufa Hunduma et al.},

  abstract = {Health economic evaluations are comparative analyses of alternative courses of action in terms of their costs and consequences. The Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) statement, published in 2013, was created to ensure health economic evaluations are identifiable, interpretable, and useful for decision making. It was intended as guidance to help authors report accurately which health interventions were being compared and in what context, how the evaluation was undertaken, what the findings were, and other details that may aid readers and reviewers in interpretation and use of the study. The new CHEERS 2022 statement replaces previous CHEERS reporting guidance. It reflects the need for guidance that can be more easily applied to all types of health economic evaluation, new methods and developments in the field, as well as the increased role of stakeholder involvement including patients and the public. It is also broadly applicable to any form of intervention intended to improve the health of individuals or the population, whether simple or complex, and without regard to context (such as health care, public health, education, social care, etc). This summary article presents the new CHEERS 2022 28-item checklist and recommendations for each item. The CHEERS 2022 statement is primarily intended for researchers reporting economic evaluations for peer reviewed journals as well as the peer reviewers and editors assessing them for publication. However, we anticipate familiarity with reporting requirements will be useful for analysts when planning studies.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acute Respiratory Infections (ARIs) are leading cause of death among children and cause 2.1 million deaths worldwide. In Pakistan, around 11.74 million ARIs cases are reported annually. Gilgit Baltistan (G-B) has higher ARIs incidence and mortality among children under 5. Study aims to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of ARI surveillance systems in GB., METHODOLOGY: Evaluation was conducted during April 2011 using CDC's updated guidelines on evaluating the public health surveillance system, 2001. Two existing surveillance systems: Health Management Information System (HMIS) and Lady Health Workers Management Information System (LHWs-MIS) were identified. Literature, documents and reports were reviewed. Stake holders were interviewed. Sensitivity was calculated using estimates of Pakistan Health \& Demographic Survey (PDHS) 2006-07., RESULTS: HMIS was simple, but inflexible in accommodating additional information. Data quality was poor due to incomplete forms; data took 30 days to reach provincial HMIS cell. Sensitivity of system was 94\% but lacked Predictive Value Positive (PVP) due to absence of laboratory confirmation. System was operational in public sector and covered 95\% population in 95\% districts. System was stable with timely and secure data collection and management. LHWs-MIS, was simple and lacked flexibility. Data quality was good and stable with adequate collection, management and provision of data. Form completion was around 90\%. However, had moderate representativeness covering about 65\% districts. Data were transmitted within 30 days while the Sensitivity was 84\%., CONCLUSIONS: LHW/MIS has better quality data and timeliness, while HMIS has better coverage. Both systems have different objectives and have problems in flexibility along with an absence of lab component. To cater for the robustness of the surveillance system, new information system with latest and appropriate technology is required.},

This report describes and evaluates the program and provides data from 1991 regarding hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive mothers and their infants' subsequent hepatitis B vaccination. The program was created using multiple existing surveillance and data collection systems. Completeness of case-ascertainment was estimated by means of the Chandra Sekar-Deming method (J Am Stat Assoc 1949; 44:101-15). An audit of hospital medical records and follow-up by local health departments were used to validate reporting accuracy. Of 158,273 live births in 1991, 363 (0.2\%) were born to confirmed HBsAg-positive mothers. Estimated completeness of case-ascertainment was 96\%. Thirty-five percent of HBsAg-positive mothers did not report risk factors for hepatitis B, confirming the need for universal testing. Of the infants, 83\% received hepatitis B immune globulin and three doses of vaccine within one year of birth. By using existing data collection systems, the program was established quickly, and start-up funding and training requirements were simplified. Multiple reporting increased case-ascertainment to almost 100\%. The program effectively identifies and ensures prompt vaccination of infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers.}

  abstract = {Introduction: The Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) epidemic devastated West Africa, with Sierra Leone recording over 50\% of the 28,610 cases across the three most affected countries. Enhanced surveillance system was developed for improved identification of cases and response in Sierra Leone. Here, we evaluated the surveillance system to determine its strengths and challenges in meeting the set objectives. Methods: The EVD surveillance system in Tonkolili District, Sierra Leone, was assessed using the CDC updated guidelines for evaluating public health surveillance. In particular, the simplicity, stability, acceptability, flexibility, representativeness, sensitivity, positive predictive value and data quality of the system were assessed using EVD surveillance data and information from key informant interviews with program stakeholders. Results: The EVD surveillance system in Tonkolili District provided information and data on disease trends and outbreak report through official and rumours sources. Case definitions were well understood by participants, with willingness to continue surveillance activities after the EVD outbreak. Standardized data collection tools were in place and data communication was clear with feedback to surveillance units at all levels. The EVD surveillance was not operated within the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response framework (IDSR). Data completeness was about 91\%, consistency existed but data quality was poor (incompletely filled data and missing data existed). Regarding timeliness, samples arrived designated laboratory within 24 - 48 hours in 174 (84.9\%). Sensitivity of the surveillance system was 88.5\%. Predictive value positive was 25.8\%. The stability was questionable since the government of Sierra Leone were not fully in charge of the system. Conclusion: While the simplicity of the EVD surveillance system in Tonkolili District facilitated its implementation, users suggested that the system did not meet expectations in terms of timeliness, flexibility and acceptability. There was a need to channel efforts towards integrating EVD surveillance into the IDSR. Data completeness and timeliness needed more attention. The District Health Management Team need to take ownership of the surveillance system for sustainability.},

  abstract = {Infectious disease surveillance systems support early warning, promote preparedness, and inform public health response. Pathogens that have human, animal, and environmental reservoirs should be monitored through systems that incorporate a One Health approach. In 2016, Thailand's federal government piloted an avian influenza (AI) surveillance system that integrates stakeholders from human, animal, and environmental sectors, at the central level and in four provinces to monitor influenza A viruses within human, waterfowl, and poultry populations. This research aims to describe and evaluate Thailand's piloted AI surveillance system to inform strategies for strengthening and building surveillance systems relevant to One Health. We assessed this surveillance system using the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (U.S. CDC) "Guidelines for Evaluating Public Health Surveillance Systems" and added three novel metrics: transparency, interoperability, and security. In-depth key informant interviews were conducted with representatives among six Thai federal agencies and departments, the One Health coordinating unit, a corporate poultry producer, and the Thai Ministry of Public Health-U.S. CDC Collaborating Unit. Thailand's AI surveillance system demonstrated strengths in acceptability, simplicity, representativeness, and flexibility, and exhibited challenges in data quality, stability, security, interoperability, and transparency. System efforts may be strengthened through increasing laboratory integration, improving pathogen detection capabilities, implementing interoperable systems, and incorporating sustainable capacity building mechanisms. This innovative piloted surveillance system provides a strategic framework that can be used to develop, integrate, and bolster One Health surveillance approaches to combat emerging global pathogen threats and enhance global health security.

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Official counts of deaths attributed to disasters are often under-reported, thus adversely affecting public health messaging designed to prevent further mortality. During the Oklahoma (USA) May 2013 tornadoes, Oklahoma State Health Department Division of Vital Records (VR; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma USA) piloted a flagging procedure to track tornado-attributed deaths within its Electronic Death Registration System (EDRS). To determine if the EDRS was capturing all tornado-attributed deaths, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; Atlanta, Georgia USA) evaluated three event fatality markers (EFM), which are used to collate information about deaths for immediate response and retrospective research efforts., METHODS: Oklahoma identified 48 tornado-attributed deaths through a retrospective review of hospital morbidity and mortality records. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; Atlanta, Georgia USA) analyzed the sensitivity, timeliness, and validity for three EFMs, which included: (1) a tornado-specific flag on the death record; (2) a tornado-related term in the death certificate; and (3) X37, the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) code in the death record for Victim of a Cataclysmic Storm, which includes tornadoes., RESULTS: The flag was the most sensitive EFM (89.6\%; 43/48), followed by the tornado term (75.0\%; 36/48), and the X37 code (56.2\%; 27/48). The most-timely EFM was the flag, which took 2.0 median days to report (range 0-10 days), followed by the tornado term (median 3.5 days; range 1-21), and the X37 code (median {$>$}10 days; range 2-122). Over one-half (52.1\%; 25/48) of the tornado-attributed deaths were missing at least one EFM. Twenty-six percent (11/43) of flagged records had no tornado term, and 44.1\% (19/43) had no X37 code. Eleven percent (4/36) of records with a tornado term did not have a flag., CONCLUSION: The tornado-specific flag was the most sensitive and timely EFM. Using the flag to collate death records and identify additional deaths without the tornado term and X37 code may improve immediate response and retrospective investigations. Moreover, each of the EFMs can serve as quality controls for the others to maximize capture of all disaster-attributed deaths from vital statistics records in the EDRS.Issa AN, Baker K, Pate D, Law R, Bayleyegn T, Noe RS.

One concern with using registry data for research is timeliness of reporting. Timeliness has been recognized as an important data characteristic by both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Academy of Medicine. Yet, few studies in the United States have systematically measured timeliness. The purpose of this study is to evaluate timeliness in cancer-case reporting to a state population-based cancer registry. METHOD: Using the Indiana State Department of Health Cancer Registry, 66,395 breast, colorectal, and lung cancer diagnoses recorded during the years 2001-2009 were examined for timeliness. Timeliness was measured from the date the cancer was diagnosed to when the data were available at the state registry. Differences over time and among the 3 cancer types were examined. RESULT: Timeliness of reporting improved since 2003. Mean reporting time ranged from 426 days in 2003 to 253 days in 2009. We found significant difference in reporting time between the 3 cancer types. CONCLUSION : Timeliness of reporting has improved over time. Advances in health information technologies may have contributed to this improvement. However, achieving even more timely reporting for research purposes and care intervention may require moving away from traditional reporting methods.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Timeliness is a key performance measure of public health surveillance systems. Timeliness can vary by disease, intended use of the data, and public health system level. Studies were reviewed to describe methods used to evaluate timeliness and the reporting timeliness of National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) data was evaluated to determine if this system could support timely notification and state response to multistate outbreaks., METHODS: Published papers that quantitatively measured timeliness of infectious disease surveillance systems operating in the U.S. were reviewed. Median reporting timeliness lags were computed for selected nationally notifiable infectious diseases based on a state-assigned week number and various date types. The percentage of cases reported within the estimated incubation periods for each disease was also computed., RESULTS: Few studies have published quantitative measures of reporting timeliness; these studies do not evaluate timeliness in a standard manner. When timeliness of NNDSS data was evaluated, the median national reporting delay, based on date of disease onset, ranged from 12 days for meningococcal disease to 40 days for pertussis. Diseases with the longer incubation periods tended to have a higher percentage of cases reported within its incubation period. For acute hepatitis A virus infection, which had the longest incubation period of the diseases studied, more than 60\% of cases were reported within one incubation period for each date type reported. For cryptosporidiosis, Escherichia coli O157:H7 infection, meningococcal disease, salmonellosis, and shigellosis, less than 40\% of cases were reported within one incubation period for each reported date type., CONCLUSION: Published evaluations of infectious disease surveillance reporting timeliness are few in number and are not comparable. A more standardized approach for evaluating and describing surveillance system timeliness should be considered; a recommended methodology is presented. Our analysis of NNDSS reporting timeliness indicated that among the conditions evaluated (except for acute hepatitis A infection), the long reporting lag and the variability across states limits the usefulness of NNDSS data and aberration detection analysis of those data for identification of and timely response to multistate outbreaks. Further evaluation of the factors that contribute to NNDSS reporting timeliness is warranted.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Effective public health surveillance system is crucial for early detection and response to disease outbreaks. In 1998, Kenya adopted the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy to strengthen disease surveillance and epidemic response. Despite that, goals of complete and timely weekly, monthly and quarterly surveillance reports from health facilities have not been achieved. In this study, we evaluated the outcomes of training healthcare workers on IDSR and implementation of electronic disease surveillance reporting system in Kwale County. Methods: We followed the completeness and timeliness of weekly, monthly and quarterly reporting from 123 health facilities in Kwale County. We compared these two surveillance indicators one month before electronic system implementation and then in period of one, three and six months after the electronic reporting system implementation. Results: Significant improvement in completeness and timeliness rate in weekly and monthly reporting was found out one month after the intervention by training activities and implementation of electronic reporting system. Significant differences were also found 3 months after the implementing electronic reporting system. When we compared completeness and timeliness rate 6 months after the electronic system implementation, we observed a decrease in both surveillance indicators and rate of reporting was almost similar to the period before intervention when disease reporting was conducted by regular paper-based form.

  abstract = {DCP2 is a comprehensive, 1440-page resource that provides an updated "checkup" for global health and health care. As part of the "health examination," DCP2 asked: What progress has been made in defining and reducing the global burden of disease? How much have countries accomplished in developing and providing efficient, effective, and equitable health care? How can they set and achieve priorities in health services? Once these countries have identified the priorities, how can they deliver interventions to the targeted population in the most cost-effective manner? How can the efforts of the health and closely related sectors (such as nutrition, agriculture, water and sanitation, and education) be integrated to optimize health improvements? DCP2's answers contribute substantially to global initiatives to improve the health of all peoples by providing a multidisciplinary understanding of these fundamental issues and challenges, as well as effective interventions for the range of communicable and noncommunicable diseases and conditions and risk factors. Underlying all medical and economic analyses is the appreciation of the need to strengthen health systems so that they can provide highly cost-effective interventions on a large scale. Applying the information, analysis, and strategies set out in DCP2 requires a careful assessment of the local situation, including patterns of disease, institutional capacity, and resources. Combining insights from DCP2 and knowledge of their local situation, actors at many levels---from parliamentarians and health ministers to hospital administrators, health care workers, and concerned citizens---will be able to set priorities, select appropriate interventions, devise better means of delivery, improve management, and be more effective in mobilizing resources. In this manner, the benefits of technical progress in improving health can be extended and shared by all.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The collaborative integrated surveillance system known as Vigilancia Integrada Comunitaria (ViCo) was implemented in 2007 to better understand and characterize the burden of diarrheal, respiratory and febrile illnesses in Guatemala., METHODS: To evaluate the usefulness of ViCo and inform a redesign of the system and new surveillance activities in the Central American region, personnel from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducted thirty-nine in-depth interviews from June-December 2018 with key stakeholders responsible for the design and implementation of ViCo in Guatemala. A semi-structured questionnaire adapted from the Updated CDC Guidelines for Evaluating Public Health Surveillance Systems was used for data collection. We used a grounded theory approach to explore stakeholder perceptions of ViCo and generate recommendations for improvement. Primary qualitative findings were organized based on thematic areas using ATLAS.ti version 8 software., RESULTS: Emergent themes relevant to the usefulness of ViCo were organized across strengths, weaknesses, and recommendations pertaining to the: (1) Size and Complexity of ViCo, (2) Stakeholder Expectations About the Objectives of ViCo, (3) Data Management and Structure of the Information System, (4) Local Control of Data, (5) Integration of ViCo within the Ministry of Health, and, (6) Improvement of the Operational and Design Aspects of ViCo across System, Process, and Output levels., CONCLUSIONS: Stakeholders perceived ViCo to be useful. They recommended measures to improve system performance and quality, including simplifying the surveillance system, routine data analysis and feedback, and channeling efforts towards integrating surveillance data into the national health information system. To create a well-performing surveillance system and achieve the intended objective of surveillance for public health action, ongoing evaluation and assessment of surveillance activities are necessary.

A community-based, monthly surveillance system was established in South Kivu, Democratic Republic of the Congo, in partnership with a local implementing partner and the national ministry of health. Data were collected on the occurrence of births, deaths, arrivals, and departures over the course of one year, and a retrospective survey was conducted at the end of the period to validate the information. Discrepancies between the two approaches were resolved by a third visit to the households with discordant records. The study found that the surveillance system was superior in terms of its specificity and sensitivity in measuring crude mortality and birth rates as compared to the survey, demonstrating the method's potential to measure accurately important population-level health metrics in an insecure setting in a timely, community-acceptable manner.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cancer is the fourth leading cause of death in Sabah Malaysia with a reported agestandardized incidence rate was 104.9 per 100,000 in 2007. The incidence rate depends on nonmandatory notification in the registry. Underreporting will provide the false picture of cancer control program effectiveness. The present study was to evaluate the performance of the cancer registry system in terms of representativeness, data quality, simplicity, acceptability and timeliness and provision of recommendations for improvement., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The evaluation was conducted among key informants in the National Cancer Registry (NCR) and reporting facilities from FebMay 2012 and was based on US CDC guidelines. Representativeness was assessed by matching cancer case in the Health Information System (HIS) and state pathology records with those in NCR. Data quality was measured through case finding and reabstracting of medical records by independent auditors. The reabstracting portion comprised 15 data items. Selfadministered questionnaires were used to assess simplicity and acceptability. Timeliness was measured from date of diagnosis to date of notification received and data dissemination., RESULTS: Of 4613 cancer cases reported in HIS, 83.3\% were matched with cancer registry. In the state pathology centre, 99.8\% was notified to registry. Duplication of notification was 3\%. Data completeness calculated for 104 samples was 63.4\%. Registrars perceived simplicity in coding diagnosis as moderate. Notification process was moderately acceptable. Median duration of interval 1 was 5.7 months., CONCLUSIONS: The performances of registry's attributes are fairly positive in terms of simplicity, case reporting sensitivity, and predictive value positive. It is moderately acceptable, data completeness and inflexible. The usefulness of registry is the area of concern to achieve registry objectives. Timeliness of reporting is within international standard, whereas timeliness to data dissemination was longer up to 4 years. Integration between existing HIS and national registration department will improve data quality.},

Completeness of enhanced data fields was poor in 78\% of submitted isolates. The median number of days to report confirmatory test results via ERS was 1day for the regional service and nine days for the national reference laboratory, which additionally conducts phenotypic testing to confirm carbapenemase negativity. Hindrances to ERS utility included: a lack of designated, ongoing resource for system maintenance, technical support and development; uncertainty about how and when to use ERS and workload. Incomplete data prevented gaining a better understanding of important risk factors and transmission routes of CPGNB in England., CONCLUSION: The ERS is the only surveillance system in England with the potential to gather intelligence on important risk factors for CPGNB to inform public health measures to control their spread. Although the ERS captures more information on CPGNB than other surveillance systems, timeliness and completeness of the enhanced data require substantial improvements in order to deliver the desired health benefits.

  abstract = {From 2004 to 2014, the incidence of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) in the United States increased 433\%, from 1.5 to 8.0 per 1,000 hospital births. The latest national data from 2014 indicate that one baby was born with signs of NAS every 15 minutes in the United States (1). NAS is a drug withdrawal syndrome that most commonly occurs among infants after in utero exposure to opioids, although other substances have also been associated with NAS. Prenatal opioid exposure has also been associated with poor fetal growth, preterm birth, stillbirth, and possible specific birth defects (2-5). NAS surveillance has often depended on hospital discharge data, which historically underestimate the incidence of NAS and are not available in real time, thus limiting states' ability to quickly direct public health resources (6,7). This evaluation focused on six states with state laws implementing required NAS case reporting for public health surveillance during 2013-2017 and reviews implementation of the laws, state officials' reports of data quality before and after laws were passed, and advantages and challenges of legally mandating NAS reporting for public health surveillance in the absence of a national case definition. Using standardized search terms in an online legal research database, laws in six states mandating reporting of NAS from medical facilities to state health departments (SHDs) or from SHDs to a state legislative body were identified. SHD officials in these six states completed a questionnaire followed by a semistructured telephone interview to clarify open-text responses from the questionnaire. Variability was found in the type and number of surveillance data elements reported and in how states used NAS surveillance data. Following implementation, five states with identified laws reported receiving NAS case reports within 30 days of diagnosis. Mandated NAS case reporting allowed SHDs to quantify the incidence of NAS in their states and to inform programs and services. This information might be useful to states considering implementing mandatory NAS surveillance.},

Although preventable, congenital syphilis (CS) increased 186\% in New York City (NYC), from 7 cases in 2017 to 20 cases in 2018. The NYC CS surveillance and prevention system (the system) collects data on pregnant New Yorkers with untreated syphilis and pregnancy outcomes including CS. We evaluated the system to determine whether it captured necessary data to identify and facilitate treatment of pregnant New Yorkers with untreated syphilis and to identify areas for system improvement. Method(s): The director of surveillance for Sexually Transmitted Infections identified 8 NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) CS stakeholders, including an analyst, researcher, data manager, director of case investigations, IT project manager, and congenital infections coordinator, with whom interviews were conducted. Using the 2001 CDC Guidelines for Evaluating Public Health Surveillance Systems, we analyzed NYC DOHMH 2018 syphilis surveillance data. Result(s): In 2018, DOHMH identified a total of 8,372 new syphilis cases. Among these cases, 99\% had an electronic laboratory report and 35\% had a paper or electronic provider report. Stakeholders indicated {\textasciitilde}50\% of female case reports were received without an indication of pregnancy status. Considerable time was therefore spent by 81 DOHMH staff to subsequently gather pregnancy information and determine that 100 (1.2\%) of the new syphilis cases were among pregnant New Yorkers with untreated syphilis, of whom 87 ultimately received treatment to prevent CS (sensitivity 87\%). Conclusion(s): Incomplete pregnancy data accompanying female syphilis case reports resulted in time-consuming investigations to ascertain pregnancy status which potentially delayed interventions. Facilitating inclusion of pregnancy status in the laboratory and provider syphilis reports and assigning specialized staff to prioritize CS prevention over other responsibilities could decrease personnel effort, time to maternal syphilis treatment, and save newborn lives.},

Laboratory-confirmed human cases of Salmonella infection from whom strains were isolated from 2007 to 2011 in France (n=38,413) were extracted from the surveillance database. Three delay intervals were defined: transport delay (strain isolation, transport from primary laboratory to national reference laboratory), analysis delay (serotyping, reporting) and total reporting delay. We calculated the median delay in days and generated the cumulative delay distribution for each interval. Variables were tested for an association with reporting delay using a multivariable generalised linear model. The median transport and analysis delays were 7 and 6 days respectively (interquartile range (IQR: 6-10 and 4-9 respectively), with a median total reporting delay of 14 days (IQR: 11-19). Timeliness was influenced by various external factors: decreasing serotype frequency, geographical zone of primary laboratory and strain isolation on Sundays were the variables most strongly associated with increased length of delay. The effect of season and day of the week of isolation was highly variable over the study period. Several areas for interventions to shorten delays are identified and discussed for both transport and analysis delays.}

Method(s): ENDSS information and the use to which it was put, were analysed. Active case searching was carried out via the Microbiologic Information System (MIS), public hospitals and the Occupational Disease Registry (ODR). A comparison was run between reported and search data. The capture-recapture method was used to compare ENDSS against hospital cases. Result(s): Risks and outbreaks were detected. Suspect cases were not reported. There was a 40\% post-search increase in cases, i.e., 40 versus a previous figure of 24. Sensitivity was estimated at 60\%. Predictive Value Positive could not be computed however. No case definition was in force. As estimated by the capture-recapture method, overall sensitivity for both ENDSS and hospital-based surveillance was 84\% (95\% IC: 70-100). The number of cases estimated by this method was 38 +/- 8. Conclusion(s): Underreporting is in evidence and, as a consequence, sensitivity is low. A case definition is called for. Response time is slowed by awaiting confirmation before reporting.

  abstract = {Background: The US public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic has required contact tracing and symptom monitoring at an unprecedented scale. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and several partners created the Text Illness Monitoring (TIM) platform in 2015 to assist US public health jurisdictions with symptom monitoring for potential novel influenza virus outbreaks. Since May 2020, 142 federal, state, and local public health agencies have deployed TIM for COVID-19 symptom monitoring. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility, benefits, and challenges of TIM to help guide decision-making for improvements and expansion to support future public health emergency response efforts. Methods: We conducted a brief online survey of previous and current TIM administrative users (admin users) from November 28 through December 21, 2020. Closed- and open-ended questions inquired about the onboarding process, decision to use TIM, groups monitored with TIM, comparison of TIM to other symptom monitoring systems, technical challenges and satisfaction with TIM, and user support. A total of 1479 admin users were invited to participate. Results: A total of 97 admin users from 43 agencies responded to the survey. Most admin users represented the Indian Health Service (35/97, 36\%), state health departments (26/97, 27\%), and local or county health departments (18/97, 19\%), and almost all were current users of TIM (85/94, 90\%). Among the 43 agencies represented, 11 (26\%) used TIM for monitoring staff exclusively, 13 (30\%) monitored community members exclusively, and 19 (44\%) monitored both staff and community members. Agencies most frequently used TIM to monitor symptom development in contacts of cases among community members (28/43, 65\%), followed by symptom development among staff (27/43, 63\%) and among staff contacts of cases (24/43, 56\%). Agencies also reported using TIM to monitor patients with COVID-19 for the worsening of symptoms among staff (21/43, 49\%) and community members (18/43, 42\%). When asked to compare TIM to previous monitoring systems, 78\% (40/51) of respondents rated TIM more favorably than their previous monitoring system, 20\% (10/51) said there was no difference, and 2\% (1/51) rated the previous monitoring system more favorably than TIM. Most respondents found TIM favorable in terms of time burden, staff burden, timeliness of the data, and the ability to monitor large population sizes. TIM compared negatively to other systems in terms of effort to enroll participants (ie, persons TIM monitors) and accuracy of the data. Most respondents (76/85, 89\%) reported that they would highly or somewhat recommend TIM to others for symptom monitoring. Conclusions: This evaluation of TIM showed that agencies used TIM for a variety of purposes and rated TIM favorably compared to previously used monitoring systems. We also identified opportunities to improve TIM; for example, enhancing the flexibility of alert deliveries would better meet admin users' varying needs. We also suggest continuous program evaluation practices to assess and respond to implementation gaps.},

  abstract = {Objective: To assess the contribution of a digital health real-time monitoring platform towards the achievement of coverage targets during a national immunisation campaign in Indonesia. Interventions: A digital health platform was introduced to facilitate real-time reporting and data visualisation. Health workers submitted reports of children immunised each day by geolocation using mobile phones. Automated reports were generated for programme managers at all levels to enable early responses to coverage gaps. Methods: Risk profiles were generated for each district to assess precampaign immunisation programme performance. Digital health platform use and progress towards targets were monitored continuously throughout the campaign. Study outcomes were total coverage and time to achieve full (100\%) coverage. Kaplan-Meier, Cox and linear regression analyses were used to estimate the associations and outcomes after adjusting for district risk profiles. A complementary qualitative assessment explored user experiences and acceptance through interviews with vaccinators and programme managers in provinces and districts selected through multistage random sampling. Results: Between August and December 2018, 6462 health facilities registered to use the digital health platform across 28 provinces and 395 districts. After adjusting for precampaign district risk profile and intracampaign delays due to vaccine hesitancy, districts with greater platform utilisation demonstrated higher coverage overall (R2=0.28, p {$<$} 0.0001) and a shorter interval to achieving full coverage ({$>$} 75\% reporting compliance; Risk Ratio 15.4, 95\% CI 5.8 to 40.6). Stronger effects were observed among districts experiencing implementation delays due to vaccine hesitancy. Results from 106 key informant interviews conducted in 6 provinces and 18 districts suggest high degrees of acceptability, ease of use and satisfaction. Conclusion: A digital health platform introduced for real-time monitoring of a national immunisation campaign in Indonesia was feasible, well liked and associated with improved problem solving and programme performance, particularly among districts affected by vaccine hesitancy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Meningitis is the inflammation of the meninges of the brain and or spinal cord. Global mortality rates vary from 2\% to 30\%. Epidemic meningitis remains a public health concern along the meningitis belt of Africa. Despite the operation of an enhanced meningitis surveillance system in Ghana, institutional mortality rates are estimated to range from 36\% to 50\%. In 2014, Yendi recorded 83 confirmed cases; with focal epidemics in some sub-municipals. We evaluated the system over a five-year period to find out whether it was achieving its objectives of systematic collection and analyses of data for the prevention or early detection of meningitis epidemics., METHODS: We used cross-sectional design. Both qualitative and quantitative data from Yendi Municipality between January 2010 and December 2015 were collected and analyzed. The updated guidelines for evaluating surveillance systems from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were used. Content analysis was performed on the responses of key informants. Surveillance data was analyzed using MS-Excel., RESULTS: Fifteen healthcare workers were interviewed. For the period under evaluation, the annual incidence of meningitis ranged from 1.6/100,000 in 2012 to 62.6/100,000 in 2014. The average case fatality rate for the period was 8.3\%. The system was sensitive, representative, and acceptable. The predictive value positive was 100\% from 2010 to 2014 and 63.3\% in 2015. Data quality was good, but timeliness of reporting was poor., CONCLUSIONS: The enhanced meningitis surveillance system in Yendi Municipality is achieving most of its objectives. However, financial constraints and poor personnel motivation pose threats to the sustainability of the system.},

Despite the widespread measles outbreak in Ginnir district of Ethiopia in 2019, an evaluation of measles surveillance systems has not been conducted. Therefore, we evaluated the performance of measles surveillance systems and key attributes in Ginnir district, Southeast Ethiopia. Methods: We conducted a concurrent embedded mixed quantitative/qualitative study in August 2019 among 15 health facilities/study units in Ginnir district. The qualitative study involved a purposively selected 15 key-informants. Data were collected using updated guidelines for evaluating surveillance systems based on CDC's Framework. Results: Records of 15 study units were reviewed and 15 key informants participated. The structure of surveillance data flow was from the community to the respective upper level. Emergency preparedness and a response plan was available only at the district level. Weekly report completeness and timeliness were 95\% and 87\% respectively. We found weak supportive supervision and feedback, and no regular analysis and interpretations of surveillance data. The participation of surveillance stakeholders in implementation of the system was good. The surveillance system was found to be useful, easy to implement, representa-tive, and can accommodate and adapt to changing operating conditions. Report documenta-tion and quality of data was poor at lower level health facilities. The stability of the system has been challenged by a shortage of budget, logistics, staff turnover and lack of update trainings. Conclusion: The surveillance system was acceptable, useful, simple, flexible, and repre-sentative. Quality of data, timeliness, and the stability of the system were attributes that require improvement. The overall performance of measles surveillance systems in prevention and control of measles was weak. Hence, regular analysis of data, preparation, and dissemination of epidemiological bulletin, capacity building, and regular supervision and feedback are recommended to enhance performance of the system.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Six out of seven of priority zoonotic diseases have been reported in the West Nile region of Uganda, a region hosting a large number of refugees. To strengthen preparedness for outbreaks, a preparedness pilot project was conceived with an implementing partner institution providing technical and logistics support to districts for surveillance, outbreak investigation, sample transportation and infection prevention and control in the human and animal health sectors. We evaluated the annual cost of this pilot program in 3 districts in Uganda's West Nile region. Method(s): An interactive, customizable model in Excel, adapted from SurvCost was built to systematically generate cost estimates over a five-year time horizon. Institutional financial data was analysed to determine annual cost categories according to resource requirements. Resources included; time for all personnel involved directly or indirectly (e.g. administrative staff), office supplies and capital costs (depreciated at 25\% using straight line method), facilities costs, laboratory supplies and transportation costs. Annual adjustment for inflation was based on the International Monetary Fund projected inflationary rate for Uganda. Total values are presented in US dollars at a rate of (1 USD=3,450 Ugx) Results: Introducing one health disease surveillance has been associated with increased capacity to timely detect and confirm zoonotic disease outbreaks in the West Nile region. With capacity of over 350 health workers built, indicator and event based reporting improved from 71.9\% in March 2018 to 95.6\% by December 2018. The annual cost of implementing a one health surveillance program is approximately \$ 487,986. The main cost drivers are personnel at 71.8\%, transport costs at 14.1\% and capital costs at 11.9\%. Over a 5-year duration, the estimated cost of implementing a disease surveillance program in Uganda's west Nile region is approximately \$ 2,439,936. Conclusion(s): This model can inform economic evaluations and budgetary decisions for districts planning similar interventions.Copyright {\copyright} 2019},

  abstract = {Objective: While the Global Database on Blood Safety (GDBS) helps to monitor the status of adequate and safe blood availability, its presence alone does not serve as a solution to existing challenges. The objective of this evaluation was to determine the GDBS usefulness in improving the availability of adequate safe blood and its ability to function as a surveillance system. Method(s): The GDBS was evaluated using methods set out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Guidelines for assessing surveillance systems. Six recommended tasks were used to evaluate if the GDBS met the requirements of a surveillance system in a public health context. Result(s): The majority of stakeholders engaged with GDBS found it was unique and useful. The GDBS answered all six questions essential for determining a blood safety surveillance system's usefulness. The GDBS fully met the needs to six of the eleven attributes used for evaluating the usefulness of a surveillance system. Conclusion(s): The GDBS is a unique global activity that provides vital data on safety of blood transfusion services across countries and regions. However, aspects of the GDBS such as timeliness of reporting and improvement of WHO Member States national blood information systems could enhance its effectiveness and potential to serve as a global surveillance system for blood safety.Copyright Published 2020.

Under - reporting is a challenge and limited epidemiological evaluations of the system have been conducted. This study evaluated the system to determine performance of the system in meeting its objectives and its attributes and provide recommendations Methods \& Materials: CDC guidance (MMWR 2001) for evaluation of public health surveillance system was used. Review of secondary data for the period 2006 - 2013, and key informant interviews were conducted. Result(s): Between 2006 and 2013, 630ADRscases were reported, 108 (1.4\%) cases reported in 2013 compared to 8000 expected cases annually. All interviewed health care providers (HCPs), know ADRs case definitions, three trained on ADRs surveillance, two send reports to TFDA. Among 36 sampled reported forms, 27 (75\%) were incompletely filled, 7(19.4\%) correctly filled, 9(25\%) received at TFDA timely. From January -December 2013, 108 cases were located in the data base while 80 cases found in reported forms. Among seven visited health facilities, five had only yellow forms and two reported ADRs cases to TFDA. Data management and analysis is done at TFDA headquarters. Conclusion(s): The system met some of its objectives: it is flexible, stable and representative but not simple, acceptable, and has poor data quality and timeliness. HCPs and public awareness on ADRs reporting should be increased. The system should be integrated into government health administrative levels, including follow ups. Supportive supervision and data transmission mechanisms should be improved.},

For effective action by decision-makers, the information and analysis obtained from surveillance systems must be used to determine the problem, the magnitude of maltreatment, its relationship with other issues, and the likelihood of preventing maltreatment. Objectives: Due to the importance of child abuse and the management and control of this event, this study was conducted to design and evaluate a child abuse surveillance system. Methods: The system was designed in Visual Studio version 2017 using the C\# programming language and ASP. NET framework. SQL Server was used to store the data. The design of the child abuse surveillance system was evaluated according to the usability evaluation.Results: The minimum data set was indexed to collect and store data on abused children by the standard format. Web-based child abuse surveillance system (CASS) has 3 types of users. The system evaluation results showed that the highest number of problems were related to the principle of "help and documentation". Conclusion: Designing a CASS is a practical step in managing and controlling the data of abused children. This system and registration of information will help professionals, managers, and decision-makers make the right decisions to take care of injured children with up-to-date information.},

Therefore, it is important to determine the status of the Iranian Maternal Mortality Surveillance System (IMMSS) to identify its pros and cons and to try to improve its quality; this is the aim of this study. Method(s): Using the content analysis approach, this qualitative study was conducted in 2016. It had two stages: the review of all related documents and the interviews of 15 key informants. The data were analyzed through framework analysis and the results were presented using a descriptive method. Result(s): The implementation of various programs, interventions to improve maternal health and the achievement of the MDG 5 were found to be the most important strengths of the IMMSS. There are several weaknesses in the system, including a lack of clear information about morbidities caused by pregnancy and birth, repeated maternal deaths due to similar causes and the lack of a system evaluation at the provincial level. Conclusion(s): We found that the IMMSS is useful. However, certain measures are recommended to improve the system performance quality. These are, for example, the establishment of a system for the surveillance of maternal morbidities and high-risk mothers, and the evaluation of a maternal mortality surveillance system at the provincial level.Copyright {\copyright} 2018 A.

  abstract = {Background In the absence of a vaccine or pharmacological treatment, prevention and control of Guinea worm disease is dependent on timely identification and containment of cases to interrupt transmission. The Chad Guinea Worm Eradication Program (CGWEP) surveillance system detects and monitors Guinea worm disease in both humans and animals. Although Guinea worm cases in humans has declined, the discovery of canine infections in dogs in Chad has posed a significant challenge to eradication efforts. A foundational information system that supports the surveillance activities with modern data management practices is needed to support continued program efficacy. Methods We sought to assess the current CGWEP surveillance and information system to identify gaps and redundancies and propose system improvements. We reviewed documentation, consulted with subject matter experts and stakeholders, inventoried datasets to map data elements and information flow, and mapped data management processes. We used the Information Value Cycle (IVC) and Data-Information System-Context (DISC) frameworks to help understand the information generated and identify gaps. Results Findings from this study identified areas for improvement, including the need for consolida-tion of forms that capture the same demographic variables, which could be accomplished with an electronic data capture system. Further, the mental models (conceptual frame-works) IVC and DISC highlighted the need for more detailed, standardized workflows specif-ically related to information management. Conclusions Based on these findings, we proposed a four-phased roadmap for centralizing data systems and transitioning to an electronic data capture system. These included: development of a data governance plan, transition to electronic data entry and centralized data storage, transition to a relational database, and cloud-based integration. The method and outcome of this assessment could be used by other neglected tropical disease programs looking to transition to modern electronic data capture systems.Copyright {\copyright} 2021, Public Library of Science.

We compared persons with ALS who were passively identified by the Registry with those actively identified in the State and Metropolitan Area ALS Surveillance project. Cases in the two projects were matched using a combination of identifiers, including, partial social security number, name, date of birth, and sex. The distributions of cases from the two projects that matched/did not match were compared and Chi-square tests conducted to determine statistical significance. There were 5883 ALS cases identified by the surveillance project. Of these, 1116 died before the Registry started, leaving 4767 cases. We matched 2720 cases from the surveillance project to those in the Registry. The cases identified by the surveillance project that did not match cases in the Registry were more likely to be non-white, Hispanic, less than 65 years of age, and from western states. The methods used by the Registry to identify ALS cases, i.e. national administrative data and self-registration, worked well but missed cases. These findings suggest that developing strategies to identify and promote the Registry to those who were more likely to be missing, e.g. non-white and Hispanic, could be beneficial to improving the completeness of the Registry.Copyright {\copyright} 2017 The Author(s).

  abstract = {Monitoring of water services informs policy and planning for national governments and the international community. Currently, the international monitoring system measures the type of drinking water source that households use. There have been calls for improved monitoring systems over several decades, some advocating use of multiple indicators. We review the literature on water service indicators and frameworks with a view to informing debate on their relevance to national and international monitoring. We describe the evidence concerning the relevance of each identified indicator to public health, economic development and human rights. We analyze the benefits and challenges of using these indicators separately and combined in an index as tools for planning, monitoring, and evaluating water services. We find substantial evidence on the importance of each commonly recommended indicator - service type, safety, quantity, accessibility, reliability or continuity of service, equity, and affordability. Several frameworks have been proposed that give structure to the relationships among individual indicators and some combine multiple indicator scores into a single index but few have been rigorously tested. More research is needed to understand if employing a composite metric of indicators is advantageous and how each indicator might be scored and scaled.}

  abstract = {Objectives: A well-functioning disease surveillance system is essential for effective control of diseases. Therefore, conducting evaluation studies on the performance of disease surveillance systems is necessary. This study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the Iranian syndrome-based surveillance system for tuberculosis (TB)in rural areas of Fars, the third largest province located in southern Iran. Study design: This was an evaluation study. Method(s): Two independent sources of information (data from a population-based survey and data from the surveillance system)were used in this evaluation. A group of trained female nurses used a specially designed interview-administered questionnaire to obtain data on the health status of family members from mothers or other adult women in rural houses. Subsequently, the nurses obtained data from individuals who reported a history of TB during a specified period and defined whether the patients presented themselves to a rural or urban health centre or clinic. Result(s): A total of 48,771 individuals participated in this study. Of 156 cases who reported a history of TB, 137 (87.82\%)presented themselves to at least one medical care provider seeking diagnosis and treatment services. Of patients who visited a health or medical centre, only 18 (13.14\%)were reported to the highest level of the surveillance system. Accordingly, the rates of underascertainment and underreporting of the Iranian surveillance system for TB were 12.18\% and 86.86\%, respectively. Moreover, underascertainment was significantly higher for men (19.40\%)than for women (6.74\%). The mean time between the date at which TB was noticed and the date of diagnosis was 56.24 days, which was longer for men (79.29 days)than for women (40.10 days). The highest and lowest levels of underreporting were observed for private general practitioners (100\%)and the health centres run by the government (87\%), respectively. Conclusion(s): The quality of the communicable disease surveillance system for TB in Iran is facing important challenges, including underascertainment, underreporting and timeliness, in addition to different types of bias. Informing the general population and health workforce about TB and the importance of timely diagnosis is a good approach to improve the performance of Iran's national communicable disease surveillance system.Copyright {\copyright} 2019 The Royal Society for Public Health},

As part of this effort, FAO has developed the ``Assessment Tool for Laboratories and AMR Surveillance Systems'' (FAO-ATLASS) to assist countries in systematically assessing their AMR surveillance system in food and agriculture. FAO-ATLASS includes two different modules for surveillance and laboratory assessment. Each module includes two questionnaires that collect either qualitative or semi-quantitative data to describe and score the performance of national AMR surveillance system data production network, data collection and analysis, governance, communication and overall sustainability in a standardized manner. Based on information captured in the questionnaire by trained assessors (1) tables and figures describing the outputs of the surveillance system are automatically generated (2) a Progressive Improvement Pathway (PIP) stage, ranging from ``1-limited'' to ``5-sustainable'', is assigned to each laboratory assessed in the country, each area of the surveillance system and also to the overarching national AMR surveillance system.

We describe and evaluate an Early Warning, Alert and Response System (EWARS) implemented in the Beni health zone of DRC during August 5, 2018-June 30, 2020. During this period, 194,768 alerts were received, of which 30,728 (15.8\%) were validated as suspected cases. From these, 801 confirmed and 3 probable cases were detected. EWARS showed an overall good performance: sensitivity and specificity {$>$}80\%, nearly all (97\%) of alerts investigated within 2 hours of notification, and good demographic representativeness. The average cost of the system was US \$438/case detected and US \$1.8/alert received. The system was stable, despite occasional disruptions caused by political insecurity. Our results demonstrate that EWARS was a cost-effective component of the Ebola surveillance strategy in this setting.Copyright {\copyright} 2021 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

  abstract = {Background: Wastewater testing offers a cost-effective strategy for measuring population disease prevalence and health behaviors. For COVID-19, wastewater surveillance addresses testing gaps and provides an early warning for outbreaks. As U.S. federal agencies build a National Wastewater Surveillance System around the pandemic, thinking through ways to develop flexible frameworks for wastewater sampling, testing, and reporting can avoid unnecessary system overhauls for future infectious disease, chronic disease, and drug epidemics. Objectives: We discuss ways to transform a historically academic exercise into a tool for epidemic response. We generalize lessons learned by a global network of wastewater researchers around validation and implementation for COVID-19 and opioids while also drawing on our experience with wastewater-based epidemiology in the United States. Discussion: Sustainable wastewater surveillance requires coordination between health and safety officials, utilities, labs, and researchers. Adapting sampling frequency, type, and location to threat level, community vulnerability, biomarker properties, and decisions that wastewater data will inform can increase the practical value of the data. Marketplace instabilities, coupled with a fragmented testing landscape due to specialization, may require officials to engage multiple labs to test for known and unknown threats. Government funding can stabilize the market, balancing commercial pressures with public good, and incentivize data sharing. When reporting results, standardizing metrics and contextualizing wastewater data with health resource data can provide insights into a community's vulnerability and identify strategies to prevent health care systems from being overwhelmed. If wastewater data will inform policy decisions for an entire community, comparing characteristics of the wastewater treatment plant's service population to those of the larger community can help determine whether the wastewater data are generalizable. Ethical protocols may be needed to protect privacy and avoid stigmatization. With data-driven approaches to sample collection, analysis, and interpretation, officials can use wastewater surveillance for adaptive resource allocation, pandemic management, and program evaluation. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP8572},

  abstract = {Background: Active acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases surveillance in children under 15 years is ongoing till reaching eradication of poliomyelitis in the globe. As there is always a high risk of importation of wild poliovirus (WPV) from the endemic countries, accurate surveillance for AFP cases to detect WPV circulation and to maintain our achievement is thoroughly essential. Objectives: To evaluate the performance of the AFP surveillance system in Kashmir Valley. To identify gaps, if any, in AFP surveillance. Materials and Methods: The Mixed Methods study was conducted in the Kashmir valley from March 2018 to March 2019. An explorative qualitative design using individual, face-to-face interviews with thirty-two (32) different stakeholders from the State, District, Medical Block, and PHC levels. To complement the qualitative study, a quantitative door-to-door survey was done in two Districts, Srinagar and Ganderbal, which consist of five and four Medical Blocks respectively. Results: The thematic qualitative analysis approach was used, and the analysis process resulted in five themes. 1. Stakeholders' description of AFP surveillance. 2. Perception and awareness, appraisal of AFP Surveillance among stakeholders 3. Barriers in reporting AFP cases 4. Forging stronger linkages, improved planning in the health system to address gaps in AFP surveillance. 5. Enhancement of activities for sensitive AFP surveillance. In door to door survey of households in different sub-centre areas, a total of n = 1304 families were visited in which maximum (n = 647) families had two {$<$}15 years' children. In the survey, only one AFP case was recorded from Sub-Centre Kurag. Conclusion: There is a need for sensitive AFP surveillance by working on various factors, including training, behavioural change of health workers, improving reporting of cases, especially efforts are needed for the formation of effective AFP surveillance system by forging cooperation with different segments of the health system.},

  abstract = {Detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral genome in wastewater has proven to be useful for tracking the trends of virus prevalence within the community. The surveillance also provides precise and early detection of any new and circulating variants, which aids in response to viral outbreaks. Site-specific monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 variants provides valuable information on the prevalence of new or emerging variants in the community. We sequenced the genomic RNA of viruses present in the wastewater samples and analyzed for the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 variants as well as other respiratory viruses for a period of one year to account for seasonal variations. The samples were collected from the Reno-Sparks metropolitan area on a weekly basis between November 2021 to November 2022. Samples were analyzed to detect the levels of SARS-CoV-2 genomic copies and variants identification. This study confirmed that wastewater monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 variants can be used for community surveillance and early detection of circulating variants and supports wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) as a complement to clinical respiratory virus testing as a healthcare response effort. Our study showed the persistence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus throughout the year compared to a seasonal presence of other respiratory viruses, implicating SARS-CoV-2's broad genetic diversity and strength to persist and infect susceptible hosts. Through secondary analysis, we further identified antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes in the same wastewater samples and found WBE to be a feasible tool for community AMR detection and monitoring.

  abstract = {As countries transition toward malaria elimination, malaria programs rely on surveillance-response systems, which are often supported by web- and mobile phone-based reporting tools. Such surveillance-response systems are interventions for elimination, making it important to determine if they are operating optimally. A metric to measure this by is timeliness. This study used a mixed-methods approach to investigate the response time of Zanzibar's malaria elimination surveillance-response system, Malaria Case Notification (MCN). MCN conducts both passive and reactive case detection, supported by a mobile phone-based reporting tool called Coconut Surveillance. Using data obtained from RTI International and the Zanzibar Malaria Elimination Program (ZAMEP), analysis of summary statistics was conducted to investigate the association of response time with geography, and time series techniques were used to investigate trends in response time and its association with the number of reported cases. Results indicated that response time varied by the district in Zanzibar (0.6-6.05 days) and that it was not associated with calendar time or the number of reported cases. Survey responses and focus groups with a cadre of health workers, district malaria surveillance officers, shed light on operational challenges faced during case investigation, such as incomplete health records and transportation issues, which stem from deficiencies in aspects of ZAMEP's program management. These findings illustrate that timely response for malaria elimination depends on effective program management, despite the automation of web-based or mobile phone-based tools. For surveillance-response systems to work optimally, malaria programs should ensure that optimal management practices are in place.},

This study aims to report on the process and results of developing a performance assessment framework to evaluate the long-term care system financed by the public long-term care insurance in South Korea. Methods: The framework was developed through a six-step approach, including setting the goals and scope of performance assessment in the given policy context, reviewing existing performance frameworks, developing a framework with a wide range of potential indicators, refining the framework through a series of Delphi surveys and expert meetings, examining the feasibility of generated indicators through a pilot test, receiving the comments of stakeholders, and finalising the performance framework. Results: The finalised framework has 4 domains - coverage, quality of care, quality of life and system sustainability - and 28 indicators, including 10 core indicators to monitor long-term care system performance. Usability and feasibility along with policy relevance were important criteria in selecting these indicators. The proposed framework can be used to assess the performance of the long-term care system in Korea, and the framework and its methodological approach can be benchmarks for other countries developing their own framework. Conclusions: It is critical to reconcile and prioritise various stakeholders' views and information needs as well as to balance methodological rigor with practical usefulness and feasibility in the development and implementation of a long-term care performance monitoring system.

This study identified under-reported and misclassified maternal deaths among women of reproductive age between 1999 and 2004 in a rural service unit in Vellore, India. In-depth interviews, semi-structured interviews and structured questionnaires were used to identify maternal deaths known to health care providers and community leaders who regularly come in contact with pregnant women. Eighteen under-reported and misclassified cases--or 50\% of maternal deaths--were reported. These included 29\% of abortion-related and 7\% of domestic violence-related deaths. Based on this study's fieldwork, the existing death surveillance system detected 100\% of the maternal deaths reported by hospital staff; however, it missed most maternal deaths reported by community workers. The latter are more likely than deaths reported by hospital workers to result from abortion and family violence. The existing surveillance system should be augmented with a community-based death surveillance system. This comprehensive approach identified twice as many maternal deaths than previously recorded and could be applied in other settings. Appropriate public health interventions should be initiated to prevent maternal deaths in this community.}

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Globally, injury is the fourth major cause of death and the third leading contributor to Disability Adjusted Life Years lost due to health conditions, with the greatest burden borne by low-middle income countries (LMICs) where injury data is scarce. In the absence of effective vital registration systems, mortuaries have been shown to provide an alternative source of cause of death information for practitioners and policy makers to establish strategic injury prevention policies and programs. This evaluation sought to assess the feasibility of implementing a standardised fatal injury data collection process to systematically collect relevant fatal injury data from mortuaries. The process evaluation is described., METHODS: A manual including a one page data collection form, coding guide, data dictionary, data entry and analysis program was developed through World Health Organization and Monash University Australia collaboration, with technical advice from an International Advisory Group. The data collection component was piloted in multiple mortuaries, in five LMICs (Egypt, India, Sri-Lanka, Tanzania and Zambia). Process evaluation was based on a questionnaire completed by each country's Principal Investigator., RESULTS: Questionnaires were completed for data collections in urban and rural mortuaries between September 2010 and February 2011. Of the 1795 reported fatal injury cases registered in the participating mortuaries, road traffic injury accounted for the highest proportion of cases, ranging from 22\% to 87\%. Other causes included burns, poisoning, drowning and falls. Positive system attributes were feasibility, acceptability, usefulness, timeliness, and simplicity and data field completeness. Some limitations included short duration of the pilot studies, limited injury data collector training and apparent underreporting of cases to the medico-legal system or mortuaries., CONCLUSION: The mortuary has been shown to be a potential data source for identifying injury deaths and their circumstances and monitoring injury trends and risk factors in LMICs. However, further piloting is needed, including in rural areas and training of forensic pathologists and data-recorders to overcome some of the difficulties experienced in the pilot countries. The key to attracting ongoing funding and support from governments and donors in LMICs for fatal injury surveillance lies in further demonstrating the usefulness of collected data.

The findings are based on interviews with key informants and focus group discussions as well as data from the CGPP and the management information system of the WHO. Through the implementing partners, the CGPP identified and built the capacity of the community-based surveillance (CBS) system, a system consisting of county supervisors, payam (sub-county) assistants, and community key informants. This structure played a critical role in the identification and reporting of AFP cases. The CGPP also established partnerships with other key players-local and international-to reach greater numbers of people, particularly displaced populations. Evaluation findings show an increase from 0.0\% to 56.4\% of cases reported through the CBS system between January 2016 and June 2017, and 80.0\% of the cases reported within WHO standards of 24-48 hours were through the CBS system, whereas 20.0\% were through the facility-based system. The CBS system also recorded an increase from 36.0\% in 2014 to 92.0\% in December 2016 for the number of counties that were reporting AFP. A CBS system is, therefore, a valuable complement to facility-based surveillance in insecure environments or where the population has limited access to facilities. Community-based surveillance systems also have the potential to identify cases of other infectious diseases of public health importance.},

  abstract = {Background. The first phase of national surveillance for avian influenza (H5N1) human disease in Thailand occurred over a 4-month period that began on 1 December 2003. Subsequently, a nationally coordinated laboratory system (NCLS) for avian influenza (H5N1) was created to assess population-based surveillance, specimen procurement, case detection, and reporting at the national level. Methods. We conducted a pre- and postintervention study to evaluate the NCLS designed during the 6-week interval from 1 April through 15 May 2004. During the pre-NCLS period (1 December 2003 through 31 March 2004), 12 cases of human avian influenza (H5N1) were confirmed. During the post-NCLS period (16 May 2004 through 31 December 2006), interventions were implemented for human avian influenza (H5N1) surveillance, case detection, and expedited, computer-based reporting. Results. During the pre- and post-NCLS periods, 777 (85\%) of 915 and 10,434 (95\%) of 11,042 clinical respiratory specimens, respectively, were adequate for confirmatory testing (P{$<$}.001), the median time from procurement to results decreased from 17 days (range, 14-24 days) to 1.8 days (range, 0.25-4 days; P{$<$}.001), and the duration of specimen shipment decreased from 46.5 h to 21.1 h (P{$<$}.001). Thirteen cases of avian influenza (H5N1) were detected during the 31-month postintervention period. H5N1 reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction sensitivity was 100\% and specificity was 99.8\%. Conclusions. The NCLS exemplifies a systematic approach to national surveillance for avian influenza A (H5N1). This NCLS program in Thailand serves as a model for human avian influenza (H5N1) preparedness that can be adopted or modified for use in other countries.},

  abstract = {Since the anthrax attacks of October 2001 and the SARS outbreaks of recent years, there has been an increasing interest in developing surveillance systems to aid in the early detection of such illness. Systems have been established which do this is by monitoring primary health-care visits, pharmacy sales, absenteeism records, and other non-traditional sources of data. While many resources have been invested in establishing such systems, relatively little effort has as yet been expended in evaluating their performance. One way to evaluate a given surveillance system is to compare the signals it generates with known outbreaks identified in other systems. In public health practice, for example, public health departments investigate reports of illness and sometimes track hospital admissions. Comparison of new systems with extant systems cannot generate estimates of test characteristics such as sensitivity and specificity, since the actual number of positives and negatives cannot be known. However, the comparison can reveal whether a new or proposed system's signals match outbreaks detected by the existing system. This could help support or reject the new system as an alternative or complement to the extant system. We propose three methods to test the null hypothesis that the new system does not signal true outbreaks more often than would be expected by chance. The methods differ in the restrictiveness of the assumptions required. Each test may detect weaknesses in the new system, depending on the distribution of outbreaks and can be used to construct confidence limits on the agreement between the new system's signals and the outbreaks, given the distribution of the signals. They can be used to assess whether the new system works in that it detects the outbreaks better than chance would suggest and can also determine if the new systems' signals are generated earlier than an extant system.

  abstract = {Background: Community-Based Surveillance (CBS) system is one component of the integrated disease surveillance and response system in Ghana. It is a surveillance system operating at the community level in which the community keeps watch for occurrences of diseases as well as other unusual health events that might indicate the presence of disease. This system relies on the community members' capacity to identify and report public health problems to the nearest health facility. The objective of the study was to determine the contribution of these volunteers to disease surveillance in the municipality. Methods and materials: We conducted a review of 2017-2018 secondary data generated by the municipality. Data on CBSVs was extracted from the database been developed by the National Surveillance Unit/Ghana Health Service to monitor the activities of the CBS pilot system and compared with suspected cases reported through the health system (DHIMS2) data. Data was manage and analyzed using MS Excel, tables, and graphs. Result(s): We found that between 2015-2016, the following suspected cases were reported: Acute flaccid paralysis 3, Measles 8, Yellow fever 8, Cholera 5, Meningitis 5 and Rabies 2. Out of these cases, none have been reported by CBS system during the 2 years period. In 2017 to 2018 when the CBS piloting was done, the following suspected cases were detected and reported; 19 Measles, 8 Yellow fever, 3 Acute flaccid paralysis, 1 Meningitis and 29 unusual health events (Dog bites, Animal deaths, Animal sickness, Snake bites, Clusters of diarrhea and vomiting). Out of these 10 Measles, 4 Yellow fever, 2 Acute flaccid paralysis and 29 unusual health events were reported by CBS system. These suspected cases were all investigated, met the case definition and appropriate samples were collected and sent to their respective laboratories. Conclusion(s): The piloting of CBS system has contributed to the high detected and reported number of suspected cases of priority diseases and unusual health events hence the need to sustain and strengthen it. We recommended to national if CBS activities can be included in DHIMS 2, provision of working logistics/equipment, motivation and re-activationof the CBS system in other districts and municipalities.Copyright {\copyright} 2020},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Every year epidemic waves of influenza and other acute respiratory infections (ARIs) cause a highly variable burden of disease in the population. Thus, assessment of the situation and adaptation of prevention strategies have to rely on real time syndromic surveillance., OBJECTIVE: We have established an ICD-10-based electronic system allowing rapid capture and transmission of information on ARI (SEEDARI), in Germany. Here we report the evaluation of this new system based on results of the syndromic and virologic surveillance carried out by the working group on influenza in Germany (AGI)., METHODS: Consultations and ICD10-codes (J00-J22, J44.0 and B34.9) between week 16 in 2009, and week 15 in 2013, were used for comparison with AGI data. The time course and the correlation of weekly estimates of the incidence of medically attended ARI (MAARI) and ARI/100 consultations were analyzed for the different surveillance systems., RESULTS: The number of participating medical practices in SEEDARI almost doubled from 2009 (n = 65) to 2013 (n = 111). A total of almost 6.8 million consultations and 465,006 diagnosed ARIs were transmitted. The comparison of weekly estimated incidence of MAARI per 100,000 capita derived from SEEDARI and the results of the AGI showed high statistical correlation (Spearman correlation coefficient rs = 0,924; n = 209; p {$<$} 0,001). The proportion of diagnosed influenza (J09-J11) and the weekly positivity rate from virological surveillance during epidemic waves also showed high correlations., DISCUSSION: We conclude that SEEDARI represents a valid system for syndromic influenza surveillance. The case-based ICD-10 approach allows a detailed analysis of the actual situation and also seems suitable for population-based studies.},

The routine health information system is used to monitor common hospital illnesses, including road traffic injuries. The objective of this study was to evaluate its performance in the surveillance of road traffic injuries in Benin in 2019. This was an evaluative study, based on updated guidelines from the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to evaluate a public health surveillance system. Performance was assessed on the basis of utility and quality criteria (simplicity, flexibility, acceptability, completeness, exhaustiveness, stability, responsiveness, representativeness and reactivity). The data collection techniques used was document review and interview. The system was considered useful and produced indicators on road traffic injuries each year within an average of five months. Its strengths were its representativeness (100\%), stability (100\%) and simplicity (83\%). Acceptability, exhaustiveness and completeness were the main areas for improvement in the system with scores of 51.4, 38.07 and 16.27\%, respectively. The routine health information system presents indicators of insufficient acceptability and low integration with other existing collection systems for road traffic injuries. Improving performance for better planning in road safety requires a more holistic approach in the implementation and functionality of the system.},

In this regard, the performance of national birth registries is not well described., METHODS: We linked clinical data from all 3,616 cleft cases treated in Norway between 1967 and 1998 with data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway, and calculated the proportion of clinically verified cases reported to the Registry, stratified by severity., RESULTS: The cleft type most completely ascertained was cleft lip and palate (CLP), of which 94\% were reported. Ascertainment was less complete for cleft lip alone (83\% recorded), and cleft palate only (CPO) (57\% recorded). For each of the three types of clefts, completeness of reporting depended on severity of the cleft. For example, 71\% of cases with severe CPO were reported, while only 11\% of cases with mild CPO were reported., CONCLUSIONS: Ascertainment was strongly related to cleft type and severity. To the degree that severity of birth defects may be related to their cause, these patterns of registration have implications for surveillance of birth defects as well as the conduct of etiologic studies. The large proportion of cleft palate cases unrecorded at birth suggests that clinical examination of the newborn palate is often inadequate.}

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Nigeria is among the countries with high Tuberculosis (TB) burden by global rating signifying the relevance of TB surveillance system evaluation in improving performance and capacity of the existing system. Hence, this evaluation was conducted in order to determine the gaps and proffer solution to enhance the TB surveillance system performance., METHODS: questionnaires were administered to eight key informants using face-to-face interview method; data obtained was analyzed. Total number of TB cases and estimated number of cases for year 2018 was obtained. Percentage of positive cases using the GeneXpert test for 6 months (January to June 2019) was obtained. Available documents and publications on the National Tuberculosis, Leprosy and Buruli Ulcer Control Programme (NTBLCP) were also sought for information., RESULTS: the NTBLCP has over 5,300 TB service points and 1,602 microscopy Centre's distributed across the country. Acceptance for the standard TB case definition was 100\%, forms used are easy to fill and diagnosis is laboratory-based requiring specialized trainings for laboratory personnel. The system had 25\% sensitivity, high data quality with 100\% timeliness. The TB surveillance system is representative of all ages. The system was first designed as TB and Leprosy Control Programme but later Buruli ulcer was incorporated into the Programme. First quarter supervisory visits are skipped due to late funding and delayed budget approval. Major share of the funding comes from donor partners., CONCLUSION: the system is useful, representative, acceptable, has good data quality, timely, and sensitive. The system is stable but needs to be funded more by the government. There is need for early funding and budget approval to avoid skipping of supervisory visits due to funding challenges. The system is not simple due the various test that need to be conducted before, during and after treatment to detect and verify that the patient is cured. We recommend continuous training of health workers, routine monitoring and evaluation, integration of TB care and prevention into other health services programmes like HIV/AIDS and active case search at all levels to increase the sensitivity of the system. Speed up the process of integration of NTBLCP surveillance system with IDSR for data harmonization in the country. Copyright {\copyright} Ayi Vandi Kwaghe et al.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Timely reporting of communicable diseases is necessary to enable a prompt response to mitigate and control outbreaks. This is especially true among First Nations communities due to a number of factors, including unique social determinants of health, which can contribute to rapid disease transmission., OBJECTIVE: To assess the timeliness of reporting for 12 notifiable communicable diseases in the Northern Inter-Tribal Health Authority, which includes 33 First Nations on-reserve communities in Northern Saskatchewan, Canada, and to assess whether there were differences in reporting times depending on degree of remoteness of community, season or year., METHODS: Data for four sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and eight other communicable diseases were abstracted from the integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS) between 2008 and 2013 and compared against the targets set for reporting in the Saskatchewan Communicable Disease Control Manual. The reporting time was defined as the duration from client exposure or presentation at clinic to the case notification day at Saskatchewan's Ministry of Health. Communicable diseases were evaluated for proportion of cases reported within recommended time, and mean reporting time. Geographical and reporting data were also recorded to assess variations in reporting time among different northern communities and according to season or year., RESULTS: A total of 9,767 records were identified for the 12 diseases; all had a 14-day recommended reporting time, with the exception of shigellosis, which had a three-day reporting time. Overall, 93.6\% of the diseases were reported in the recommended reporting time, although there was variability among the diseases. All four of the STIs (chlamydia, gonococcal infections, HIV and syphilis) had over 90\% of cases reported within the 14-day recommended time period. Other communicable diseases reporting times varied from a high of 93.4\% for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 91.7\% for lab-confirmed influenza and 89.1\% for streptococcal A-invasive disease to a low of 16.2\% for shigellosis and 12.2\% for pertussis. Salmonellosis and pneumococcal-invasive disease were intermediary with 77.4\% and 72.2\%, respectively. Mean reporting times indicated that eight of the 12 diseases (66.7\%) had reporting times similar to or better than recommended times. There appeared to be a correlation between longer reporting periods and the more northern communities. There were no seasonal variations found but yearly-trend analysis demonstrated an anomalous year in 2011, in which all communicable diseases with the exception of STIs experienced a peak in reporting delays., CONCLUSION: Overall, communicable disease reporting in this northern health authority program met recommended reporting times, although there were variations according to the disease, the area reporting and the year. Further research is needed to understand these variations in order to inform efforts to strengthen communicable disease surveillance among First Nations communities.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: With over 80\% of children worldwide vaccinated, concerns about vaccine safety continues to be a public health issue. Ghana's Adverse Events Following Immunization surveillance started in 1978 with the objective to promptly detect and manage AEFI cases either real or perceived. Periodic evaluation of the surveillance system is critical for optimal performance; hence we evaluated the system to assess its attributes, usefulness and system's performance in meeting its objectives., METHODS: A case of AEFI was defined as any untoward medical event occurring within 28 days after vaccination and may not necessarily have causal relationship with the vaccine use. We reviewed surveillance data and procedures for the period 2014 to 2018 and interviewed key stakeholders. Adapting the CDC's Updated Guidelines for Evaluating Public Health Surveillance Systems, we assessed the system's attributes and usefulness. We performed summary descriptive statistics on quantitative data and directed content analysis on information gathered from interviews., RESULTS: In all, 2,282 AEFI cases including 476 (21\%) serious cases (life threatening events) were reported for the period. The highest case detection rates of 61.45 AEFIs per 100,000 surviving infants was recorded in 2018. Reporting forms were modified to accommodate new indicators without any disruption in the function of the system. At the national level, completeness of 100 randomly sampled reporting forms (100\%) and was higher than the region (27\%) but timeliness (50\%) was lower than the region (83\%). All (16/16) Community Health Nurses interviewed indicated "fear of being victimized" as the reason for underreporting, nonetheless, the system was useful as it made them cautious when vaccinating children to prevent reactions. Data on AEFI surveillance was also useful in guiding training needs and provision of vaccination logistics., CONCLUSION: The AEFI surveillance system is useful at all levels but partially meeting its objective due to underreporting. We recommend training and supportive supervision to improve timeliness of reporting, data completeness and acceptability.},

One Health calls upon the human, animal and environmental health sectors to cross professional, disciplinary and institutional boundaries, and to work in a more integrated fashion. At the global level, this paper argues that this vision is hindered by dysfunctions characterising current forms of global health governance (GHG), namely institutional proliferation, fragmentation, competition for scarce resources, lack of an overarching authority, and donor-driven vertical programmes. This has contributed, in part, to shortcomings in how One Health has been articulated to date. An agreed operational definition of One Health among key global institutions, efforts to build One Health institutions from the ground up, comparative case studies of what works or does not work institutionally, and high-level global support for research, training and career opportunities would all help to enable One Health to help remedy, and not be subsumed by, existing dysfunctions in GHG.},

  abstract = {The epidemic of Ebola virus disease (Ebola) in West Africa began in Guinea in late 2013 (1), and on August 8, 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the epidemic a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (2). Guinea was declared Ebola-free on December 29, 2015, and is under a 90 day period of enhanced surveillance, following 3,351 confirmed and 453 probable cases of Ebola and 2,536 deaths (3). Passive surveillance for Ebola in Guinea has been conducted principally through the use of a telephone alert system. Community members and health facilities report deaths and suspected Ebola cases to local alert numbers operated by prefecture health departments or to a national toll-free call center. The national call center additionally functions as a source of public health information by responding to questions from the public about Ebola. To evaluate the sensitivity of the two systems and compare the sensitivity of the national call center with the local alerts system, the CDC country team performed probabilistic record linkage of the combined prefecture alerts database, as well as the national call center database, with the national viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) database; the VHF database contains records of all known confirmed Ebola cases. Among 17,309 alert calls analyzed from the national call center, 71 were linked to 1,838 confirmed Ebola cases in the VHF database, yielding a sensitivity of 3.9\%. The sensitivity of the national call center was highest in the capital city of Conakry (11.4\%) and lower in other prefectures. In comparison, the local alerts system had a sensitivity of 51.1\%. Local public health infrastructure plays an important role in surveillance in an epidemic setting.},

  abstract = {Classical Swine Fever (CSF) is a porcine viral disease that has severe consequences on animal health, welfare, and production. In Switzerland six broad levels of on-farm intervention measures are considered depending on the assessment of the epidemiological status of the focal farm, of the neighbouring farms and of the country; Basic biosecurity (I0), Basic biosecurity with reinforced surveillance (I0b), Surveillance zone (I1), Protection Zone (I2), Quarantine (I3) and Culling (I4). In 2014 an exclusion component was added to allow testing for CSF without implementing quarantine or movement restrictions. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of this current system. A stochastic farm-based model was developed which simulates the spread of CSF through Swiss pig farms in space and time, taking account of the implementation of intervention measures based on the system of surveillance. Two measures of effectiveness of the current system were assessed 1) the number of infected farms per outbreak and 2) the probability of implementing an intervention strategy (I0-I4) that is not strong enough given the true epidemiological status. Costs of the outbreak included the cost of implementing interventions and the costs of culling all animals determined to be infected over the course of the outbreak The median number of infected farms per outbreak was 80. Among all the simulations, 1.4\% (14/1000 simulations) did not lead to an outbreak. The median probabilities of errors, over all simulations, for the different possible intervention measures to be implemented at the time when a farm becomes infectious were highest for basic biosecurity level with reinforced surveillance (I0b), then surveillance zone measures (I1), basic biosecurity level (I0), and finally protection zone measures (I2) with the lowest probability. The median costs endorsed at federal level were 3.4 million CHF per outbreak. The cost-effectiveness of the system was evaluated as medium. The exclusion component was evaluated as good, balancing its low price of implementation, the level of biosecurity implemented at farms and the risk of CSF incursion in Switzerland. We suggest that changes in the surveillance strategy that would increase the probability of reinforced surveillance (I0b, I1, I2) to be implemented at the time a farm becomes infectious would increase the cost-effectiveness of the system. Such changes could include increasing awareness among stakeholders or developing new actions after the first outbreak, such as more intense investigations among connected farms.Copyright {\copyright} 2019},

  abstract = {Background: Private sector malaria programmes contribute to government-led malaria elimination strategies in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Myanmar by increasing access to quality malaria services and surveillance data. However, reporting from private sector providers remains suboptimal in many settings. To support surveillance strengthening for elimination, a key programme strategy is to introduce electronic surveillance tools and systems to integrate private sector data with national systems, and enhance the use of data for decision-making. During 2013-2017, an electronic surveillance system based on open source software, District Health Information System 2 (DHIS2), was implemented as part of a private sector malaria case management and surveillance programme. The electronic surveillance system covered 16,000 private providers in Myanmar (electronic reporting conducted by 200 field officers with tablets), 710 in Cambodia (585 providers reporting through mobile app), and 432 in Laos (250 providers reporting through mobile app). Method(s): The purpose of the study was to document the costs of introducing electronic surveillance systems and mobile reporting solutions in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Myanmar, comparing the cost in different operational settings, the cost of introduction and maintenance over time, and assessing the affordability and financial sustainability of electronic surveillance. The data collection methods included extracting data from PSI's financial and operational records, collecting data on prices and quantities of resources used, and interviewing key informants in each setting. The costing study used an ingredients-based approach and estimated both financial and economic costs. Result(s): Annual economic costs of electronic surveillance systems were \$152,805 in Laos, \$263,224 in Cambodia, and \$1,310,912 in Myanmar. The annual economic cost per private provider surveilled was \$82 in Myanmar, \$371 in Cambodia, and \$354 in Laos. Cost drivers varied depending on operational settings and number of private sector outlets covered in each country; whether purchased or personal mobile devices were used; and whether electronic (mobile) reporting was introduced at provider level or among field officers who support multiple providers for case reporting. Conclusion(s): The study found that electronic surveillance comprises about 0.5-1.5\% of national malaria strategic plan cost and 7-21\% of surveillance budgets and deemed to be affordable and financially sustainable.Copyright {\copyright} 2021, The Author(s).},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) have become the main public health concern worldwide. With rapid economic development and changes in lifestyles, the burden of NCDs in China is increasing dramatically every year. Monitoring is a critical measure for NCDs control and prevention. However, because of the lack of regional representativeness, unsatisfactory data quality, and inefficient data sharing and utilization, the existing surveillance systems and surveys in China cannot track the status and transition of NCDs epidemic., OBJECTIVE: To efficaciously track NCDs epidemic in China, this pilot program conducted in Ningbo city by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) aimed to develop an innovative model for NCDs surveillance and management: the integrated noncommunicable disease collaborative management system (NCDCMS)., METHODS: This Ningbo model was designed and developed through a 3-level (county/district, municipal, and provincial levels) direct reporting system based on the regional health information platform. The uniform data standards and interface specifications were established to connect different platforms and conduct data exchanges. The performance of the system was evaluated based on the 9 attributes of surveillance system evaluation framework recommended by the US CDC., RESULTS: NCDCMS allows automatic NCDs data exchanging and sharing via a 3-level public health data exchange platform in China. It currently covers 201 medical institutions throughout the city. Compared with previous systems, automatic popping up of the report card, automatic patient information extraction, and real-time data exchange process have highly improved the simplicity and timeliness of the system. The data quality meets the requirements to monitor the incidence trend of NCDs accurately, and the comprehensive data types obtained from the database (ie, directly from the 3-level platform on the data warehouse) also provide a useful information to conduct scientific studies. So far, 98.1\% (201/205) of medical institutions across Ningbo having been involved in data exchanges with the model. Evaluations of the system performance showed that NCDCMS has high levels of simplicity, data quality, acceptability, representativeness, and timeliness., CONCLUSIONS: NCDCMS completely reshaped the process of NCD surveillance reporting and had unique advantages, which include reducing the work burden of different stakeholders by data sharing and exchange, eliminating unnecessary redundancies, reducing the amount of underreporting, and structuring population-based cohorts. The Ningbo model will be gradually promoted elsewhere following this success of the pilot project, and is expected to be a milestone in NCDs surveillance, control, and prevention in China.

  abstract = {Objective: To assess the prevalence and management of preterm birth and low birth weight (LBW) infants, including the exploration of known risk factors for preterm birth and LBW, recorded in field testing of a web-based surveillance system of maternal-newborn health in southern Thailand. Material and Methods: The data of 2,459 women who delivered in six community hospitals and two referral hospitals in Songkhla province, southern Thailand were extracted from the field testing records of an experimental surveillance system. The incidences of preterm and LBW and their management with attributed factors to the specific problems and associated factors were analyzed by univariate analysis and multiple logistic regression. Results: The incidences of preterm birth and LBW were 5.6\% and 9.8\%, respectively. Maternal age, parity, preeclampsia, antenatal care visits, birth attendant and type of hospital were significantly associated with the incidence of preterm birth or LBW. Of women with preterm birth, 8.4\% received a tocolytic and 25.3\% received corticosteroids. Half of the women with preterm birth were investigated for infection. More than half of the LBW births were related to a preterm condition and most of the LBW infants were appropriately resuscitated, given appropriate hypothermia prevention and early feeding, and infection prevention measures applied. Approximately 25.0\% of the preterm and LBW infants had adverse fetal outcomes. Well-known limited factors were found in few cases of preterm and LBW infants. Conclusion: The incidence of preterm and LBW births and their management can be monitored in a timely way from a web-based surveillance system. {\copyright} 2019, Prince of Songkla University.

  abstract = {As one of the most serious meteorological disasters in modern society, air pollution has received extensive attention from both citizens and decision-makers. With the complexity of pollution components and the uncertainty of prediction, it is both critical and challenging to construct an effective and practical early-warning system. In this paper, a novel hybrid air quality early-warning system for pollution contaminant monitoring and analysis was proposed. To improve the efficiency of the system, an advanced attribute selection method based on fuzzy evaluation and rough set theory was developed to select the main pollution contaminants for cities. Moreover, a hybrid model composed of the theory of "decomposition and ensemble", an extreme learning machine and an advanced heuristic algorithm was developed for pollution contaminant prediction; it provides deterministic and interval forecasting for tackling the uncertainty of future air quality. Daily pollution contaminants of six major cities in China were selected as a dataset to evaluate the practicality and effectiveness of the developed air quality early-warning system. The superior experimental performance determined by the values of several error indexes illustrated that the proposed early-warning system was of great effectiveness and efficiency.},

The completeness of registration information and questionnaire, accuracy of case inclusion and timeliness of case registration, specimen collection and transportation. Results: A total of 11 091 SARI cases were reported. The completeness rates of registration information and questionnaire were 83.4\% and 95.6\%, respectively. Among the reported cases, 12.5\% didn't meet the case definition, and the main reason was lack of cough symptoms (81.1\%). The timeliness rates of cases registration, specimen collection and specimen transportation were 81.4\%, 84.7\% and 76.4\%, respectively. Up to 99.6\% of the cases were reported from the sentinel departments. Conclusion: The data quality of China's SARI sentinel surveillance system was good, but some efforts are still needed to improve the completeness of registration information, accuracy of reported case and timeliness of specimen transportation. It is suggested to fill all the information items in the registration form, strengthen the professional training about case definition and find the reason for the low timeliness of specimen transportation.},

A total of 8,448 HepC-relevant cases were reviewed and this data was then inquired against the 6,147 archived HepC reports during the same time period. The performance of the HepC surveillance program was evaluated using parameters including Timely Reporting Rate (TRR), pairs of Report Sensitivity (RS)/Underreporting Rate (UR), and False Report Rate (FRR)/Predictive Value Positive (PVP). Longitudinal comparisons of report quality over the three examined years were conducted to determine the temporal trend of HepC surveillance accountability. Results. All HepC reports were submitted within 24 hours post diagnosis, and TRR rates for all examined years remained at 100\%. The RS rates significantly improved overtime for clinically diagnosed HepC cases (CDHC) (2014:60.32\%, 2015:68.13\%, and 2016:82.83\%), whereas the RS for confirmed HepC cases (CHC) remained relatively constant (80.77\%, 88.64\%, and 85.82\%). The FRR rates for CDHC and CHC in 20152016 were both approximately 30\% but at 23.61\% and 51.85\%, respectively, in 2014. Conclusions. The HepC surveillance system in Henan remains effective and consistent improvement in report accountability was observed over time.

PulseNet USA has created a national framework for pathogen-specific surveillance, but no comparable effort has been made to improve surveillance of consumer complaints of suspected foodborne illness. The purpose of this study was to characterize the complaint surveillance system in Minnesota and to evaluate its use for detecting outbreaks. Minnesota Department of Health foodborne illness surveillance data from 2000 through 2006 were analyzed for this study. During this period, consumer complaint surveillance led to detection of 79\% of confirmed foodborne outbreaks. Most norovirus infection outbreaks were detected through complaints. Complaint surveillance also directly led or contributed to detection of 25\% of salmonellosis outbreaks. Eighty-one percent of complainants did not seek medical attention. The number of ill persons in a complainant's party was significantly associated with a complaint ultimately resulting in identification of a foodborne outbreak. Outbreak confirmation was related to a complainant's ability to identify a common exposure and was likely related to the process by which the Minnesota Department of Health chooses complaints to investigate. A significant difference (P {$<$} 0.001) was found in incubation periods between complaints that were outbreak associated (median, 27 h) and those that were not outbreak associated (median, 6 h). Complaint systems can be used to detect outbreaks caused by a variety of pathogens. Case detection for foodborne disease surveillance in Minnesota happens through a multitude of mechanisms. The ability to integrate these mechanisms and carry out rapid investigations leads to improved outbreak detection. Copyright {\copyright} international Association for Food Protection.}

The data for receipts and exports of blood from each hospital information system were converted into comma-separated value files according to a specific conversion rule. The daily data from the sites could be transferred to the web-based program server using a semi-automated submission procedure: pressing a key allowed the program to automatically compute the blood inventory level as well as other indices including the minimal inventory ratio (MIR), ideal inventory ratio (IIR), supply index (SI) and utilisation index (UI). The national surveillance system was referred to as the Korean Blood Inventory Monitoring System (KBIMS) and the web-based program for KBIMS was referred to as the Blood Inventory Monitoring System (BMS). A total of 30 256 red blood cell (RBC) units were submitted as receipt data, however, only 83\% of the receipt data were submitted to the BMS server as export data (25 093 RBC units). Median values were 2.67 for MIR, 1.08 for IIR, 1.00 for SI, 0.88 for UI and 5.33 for the ideal inventory day. The BMS program was easy to use and is expected to provide a useful tool for monitoring hospital inventory levels. This information will provide baseline data regarding the supply and demand of blood products in South Korea.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To improve the timely diagnosis and treatment of sepsis many institutions implemented automated sepsis alerts. Poor specificity, time delays, and a lack of actionable information lead to limited adoption by bedside clinicians and no change in practice or clinical outcomes. We aimed to compare sepsis care compliance before and after a multi-year implementation of a sepsis surveillance coupled with decision support in a tertiary care center., DESIGN: Single center before and after study., SETTING: Large academic Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) and Emergency Department (ED)., POPULATION: Patients 18 years of age or older admitted to *** Hospital MICU and ED from 09/4/2011 to 05/01/2018 with severe sepsis or septic shock., INTERVENTIONS: Electronic medical record-based sepsis surveillance system augmented by clinical decision support and completion feedback., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There were 1950 patients admitted to the MICU with the diagnosis of severe sepsis or septic shock during the study period. The baseline characteristics were similar before (N = 854) and after (N = 1096) implementation of sepsis surveillance. The performance of the alert was modest with a sensitivity of 79.9\%, specificity of 76.9\%, positive predictive value (PPV) 27.9\%, and negative predictive value (NPV) 97.2\%. There were 3424 unique alerts and 1131 confirmed sepsis patients after the sniffer implementation. During the study period average care bundle compliance was higher; however after taking into account improvements in compliance leading up to the intervention, there was no association between intervention and improved care bundle compliance (Odds ratio: 1.16; 95\% CI: 0.71 to 1.89; p-value 0.554). Similarly, the intervention was not associated with improvement in hospital mortality (Odds ratio: 1.55; 95\% CI: 0.95 to 2.52; p-value: 0.078)., CONCLUSIONS: A sepsis surveillance system incorporating decision support or completion feedback was not associated with improved sepsis care and patient outcomes.

  abstract = {Introduction: The completeness and timeliness of the pertussis questionnaire-based enhanced surveillance system (ESS) among infants and reported pertussis data within the electronic nationwide notification system (NNS) in the years 2015, 2017 and 2019 were evaluated in a pilot study. Methods: The completeness of the variables for demographic characteristics, date of symptom onset, hospitalisation and vaccination status were assessed in both systems. Timeliness of reporting in the NNS was analysed as the interval between symptom onset and (a) the date of first specimen collection (diagnostic delay), and (b) the date of the Regional Public Health Authority receiving notification (notification delay). Results: A total of 121 confirmed pertussis cases were reported to the NNS in the study years, while in the ESS a total of 104 confirmed cases were reported in infants. In both systems most cases were in the age group of one completed month of life (20\% versus 23\%) and males (55\% versus 55\%). The majority of cases were hospitalised (81\% versus 85\%) and unvaccinated (77\% versus 78\%). Within the NNS, the first dose of vaccine was reported in 13 cases, the second dose in 11, and third dose in three cases. Within the NNS, 100\% completeness of following variables was found: symptom onset, week and region of reporting, age, gender and place of isolation. Median diagnostic delay was nine days. Median notification delay was 18 days. Conclusions: Data completeness was high in the NNS, except for lack of vaccination data in those eligible by age. Efforts to improve the completeness of laboratory-related variables and timeliness are essential. Based on the study results, the project of improving the ESS for infants will continue with regular evaluation.},

  abstract = {Aim: The aim of study was to evaluate completeness and estimate sensitivity of the measles surveillance using the new electronic version of the national notification system of infectious diseases (ISIN) in order to assess its performance. Material(s) and Method(s): The completeness of measles reporting in the ISIN for demographic characteristics (week and region of re-porting, age and gender), date of onset, complications, hospitalisations, vaccination status, used laboratory methods and country of import from January 2018 to June 2019 was assessed. The register from National Reference Laboratory (NRL) and the ISIN were compared using the capture-recapture method (CRM). Cases were matched using unique personal identifier. The total number of measles cases in the population was assessed using the Chapman's formula. Sensitivity of reporting was calculated by dividing the number of reported cases by the CRM estimated true number of cases. Result(s): In the ISIN, 765 measles cases were registered within specified time period. For many variables 100\% completeness was found. The data were missing mainly for vaccination status (20\%), serology results (55\%) and used laboratory methods (8\%). The NRL confirmed 653 patient samples in respected period. Within both registries (ISIN and NRL) the total 612 cases were matched. Estimated real number of measles cases using the CRM was 816 (95\% CI: 809-823) compared to 806 reported cases. The estimated surveillance system sensitivity was 98.8\%. Five percent (n = 41) of cases tested positively in the NRL were not reported to the ISIN. Conclusion(s): We found high level of reported measles data completeness in the ISIN for most variables. Estimated real and reported number of cases was in a good correlation and calculated sensitivity of the ISIN was on very high level. Though, the data sources used in the study were not independent on each other, therefore results may not be fully accurate. The technical changes (more mandatory fields and more logical syntax to check data) in the ISIN to improve data completeness are being recommended. Data providers should report all measles cases to the ISIN with maximum precision in entering individual variables and investigating laboratories should send samples for confirmation to the NRL in required cases.Copyright {\copyright} 2022, Czech Medical Association J.E.

A survey on the quality of notifiable communicable disease reporting was conducted on 26 medical institutions in PLA chosen by stratified random sampling. The overall underreporting rate was 21.40\%. The underreporting rate of Class C communicable diseases (31.48\%) was higher than that of Class B communicable diseases (19.59\%); the difference had statistical significance ({$\chi$}2=16.78, P=0.000). The underreporting rates in the outpatient departments, inpatient departments and laboratories were 16.99\%, 24.42\% and 35.98\%, respectively; the difference had statistical significance ({$\chi$}2=65.99, P=0.000). There were no statistically significant differences on underreporting rates in medical institutions at different levels; the rate was 20.74\% in general hospitals and 22.17\% in central hospitals, but the completeness and accuracy rates of reporting were higher than the timeliness rate in both levels of hospitals. The timeliness rate of Class B communicable diseases reporting (65.78\%) was higher than that of Class C communicable diseases (48.94\%); the difference had statistical significance ({$\chi$}2=24.31, P=0.000). In conclusion, the communicable disease reporting system in PLA medical institutions should be improved and the reporting of communicable diseases should be strengthened by standard management in PLA medical institutions at all levels.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 1998, following the detection of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in the UK, Belgium installed a surveillance system for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). The objectives of this system were to identify vCJD cases and detect increases in CJD incidence. Diagnostic confirmation of CJD is based on autopsy after referral by neurologists. Reference centres perform autopsies and report to the surveillance system. The aim of this study was to assess whether the system met its objectives and to assess its acceptability., METHODS: For 1999-2010, we linked surveillance data with hospital discharge data. We calculated the proportion of CJD suspected patients who died in hospitals and were captured by the surveillance system. We surveyed stakeholders on knowledge of the surveillance system, referral practices and acceptability. We compared proportions using the chi-square test and investigated variables associated with capture using a multivariable logistic regression model., RESULTS: On average 60 \% of hospitalised patients who died with suspected CJD were captured by the surveillance system. This proportion did not significantly differ over the years (p = 0.1). The odds of capture significantly decreased with every 1 year increase in age (OR = 0.95, 95 \% CI 0.92-0.98, p = 0.001). Eleven percent of surveyed neurologists would not refer suspect vCJD cases for autopsy, nor contact a reference centre for diagnostic support. Sixty-one percent of surveyed neurologists were not familiar with the surveillance system. Awareness of the existence of the system did not impact referral behaviour (p = 0.18). CJD and vCJD surveillance were considered important by the majority of stakeholders., CONCLUSIONS: Although 40 \% of the suspect CJD cases were not referred for autopsy, our data suggest that the Belgian CJD surveillance system meets one of its main objectives: it can detect changes in CJD incidence. However, we do not have sufficient evidence to conclude that the system meets its second objective of detecting vCJD cases arising in Belgium. Although not well known, the system was considered acceptable by its stakeholders.}

Methods: Data on influenza surveillance were collected from 2011 to 2013 in Jining, and statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 15.0 after collating data in Excel 2007. Results: The percentage of cases of influenza-like illness (IL1\%) was 2.00\% from 2011 to 2012, and the ILI\% peaked at 4.89\% in Week 50 of 2011. The ILI\% was 1.38\% from 2012 to 2013, and the ILI\% peaked at 2.00\% in Week 6 of 2013. There were significant differences ({$\chi$}2=1080.69, P{$<$}0.01) in the ILI\% during the 2 years of surveillance. Winter and spring marked the peak in influenza epidemics. Patients were mostly children under the age of 5. The IL1\% at state sentinel hospitals was higher than that at provincial sentinel hospitals. Responses to outbreaks were standardized. Up to 30 strains were isolated each year, but ILI is not promptly reported, specimens are not promptly inspected, and efforts to isolate viruses are not full-fledged. Conclusion: The influenza surveillance system is operating normally in Jining, but there is varying decline in the quality of surveillance. Training of personnel and technical guidance should be enhanced, and the influenza surveillance network should be managed appropriately and its quality should be maintained.}

  abstract = {Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) community transmission was eliminated in Australia from 1/11/2020 to 30/6/2021, allowing evaluation of surveillance system performance in detecting novel outbreaks, including against variants of concern (VoCs). This paper aims to define system requirements for coro-navirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) surveillance under future transmission and response scenarios, based on surveillance system performance to date. Methods: This study described and evaluated surveillance systems and epidemiological characteristics of novel outbreaks based on publicly available data, and assessed surveillance system sensitivity and timeliness in outbreak detection. These findings were integrated with analysis of other critical COVID-19 public health measures to establish future COVID-19 management requirements. Results: Twenty-five epidemiologically distinct outbreaks and five distinct clusters were identified in the study period, all linked through genomic sequencing to novel introductions from international travellers. Seventy percent (21/30) were detected through community testing of people with acute respiratory illness, and 30\% (9/30) through quarantine screening. On average, 2.07\% of the State population was tested in the week preceding detection for those identified through community surveillance. From 17/30 with publicly available data, the average time from seeding to detection was 4.9 days. One outbreak was preceded by unexpected positive wastewater results. Twenty of the 24 outbreaks in 2021 had publicly available sequencing data, all of which identified VoCs. A surveillance strategy for future VoCs similar to that used for detecting SARS-CoV-2 would require a 100-1000-fold increase in genomic sequencing capacity compared to the study period. Other essential requirements are maintaining outbreak response capacity and developing capacity to rapidly engineer, manufacture, and distribute variant vaccines at scale. Conclusions: Australia's surveillance systems performed well in detecting novel introduction of SARS-CoV-2 while community transmission was eliminated; introductions were infrequent and case numbers were low. Detection relied on quarantine screening and community surveillance in symptomatic members of the general population, supported by comprehensive genomic sequencing. Once vaccine coverage is maximised, future COVID-19 control should shift},

  abstract = {The Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community-Based Epidemics, or ESSENCE II, uses syndromic and nontraditional health information to provide very early warning of abnormal health conditions in the National Capital Area (NCA). ESSENCE II is being developed for the Department of Defense Global Emerging Infections System and is the only known system to combine both military and civilian health care information for daily outbreak surveillance. The National Capital Area has a complicated, multijurisdictional structure that makes data sharing and integrated regional surveillance challenging. However, the strong military presence in all jurisdictions facilitates the collection of health care information across the region. ESSENCE II integrates clinical and nonclinical human behavior indicators as a means of identifying the abnormality as close to the time of onset of symptoms as possible. Clinical data sets include emergency room syndromes, private practice billing codes grouped into syndromes, and veterinary syndromes. Nonclinical data include absenteeism, nurse hotline calls, prescription medications, and over-the-counter self-medications. Correctly using information marked by varying degrees of uncertainty is one of the more challenging aspects of this program. The data (without personal identifiers) are captured in an electronic format, encrypted, archived, and processed at a secure facility. Aggregated information is then provided to users on secure Web sites. When completed, the system will provide automated capture, archiving, processing, and notification of abnormalities to epidemiologists and analysts. Outbreak detection methods currently include temporal and spatial variations of odds ratios, autoregressive modeling, cumulative summation, matched filter, and scan statistics. Integration of nonuniform data is needed to increase sensitivity and thus enable the earliest notification possible. The performance of various detection techniques was compared using results obtained from the ESSENCE II system.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a chronic, zoonotic, multi-species disease of cattle caused by Mycobacterium bovis. In developed countries, effective surveillance and enforcement of regulations on bTB control resulted in significant reduction of infections in cattle and hence, humans. However, in developing countries, weak surveillance systems affect accurate and timely reporting of bTB in humans and cattle. In Ghana, transhumance movement of cattle increases the risk of bTB importation and spread, however, the extent to which surveillance detects bTB is unknown. We therefore evaluated the bTB surveillance system in the Greater-Accra Region to determine its performance and assessed its attributes., METHODS: We interviewed stakeholders, and reviewed bTB surveillance data for all ten districts in the region from 2006-2011 using the CDC Guidelines for Evaluation of public health surveillance systems., RESULTS: From 2006-2011, bTB was suspected in 284/244,576 (0.12\%) cattle slaughtered, of which 7/284 (2.5\%) were submitted for laboratory confirmation and all tested positive. Predictive value positive was 100\%. There is no standard case definition which guides bTB detection. Fifty percent of carcasses slip through inspection, and confirmed cases are not traced back. There were 99/284 (34.9\%) condemnations from suspected carcasses and 57/97 (58.8\%) from positive reactors from screening. Ninety percent (9/10) of districts submitted reports late to the region whereas representativeness was 30\%. Regional and district data were manually stored with no electronic backups. The region's cattle population is unknown., CONCLUSION: Although the bTB surveillance system is sensitive, it is under performing, and the possibility of bTB transmission from cattle to humans is high.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe a crowdsourced disease surveillance project (EpiCore) and evaluate its usefulness in obtaining information regarding potential disease outbreaks., METHODS: Volunteer human, animal and environmental health professionals from around the world were recruited to EpiCore and trained to provide early verification of health threat alerts in their geographical region via a secure, easy-to-use, online platform. Experts in the area of emerging infectious diseases sent requests for information on unverified health threats to these volunteers, who used local knowledge and expertise to respond to requests. Experts reviewed and summarized the responses and rapidly disseminated important information to the global health community through the existing event-based disease surveillance network, ProMED., FINDINGS: From March 2016 to September 2017, 2068 EpiCore volunteers from 142 countries were trained in methods of informal disease surveillance and use of the EpiCore online platform. These volunteers provided 790 individual responses to 759 requests for information addressing unverified health threats in 112 countries; 361 (45\%) responses were considered to be useful. Most responses were received within hours of the requests. The responses led to 194 ProMED posts, of which 99 (51\%) supported verification of an outbreak, were published on ProMED and sent to over 87 000 subscribers., CONCLUSION: There is widespread willingness among health professionals around the world to voluntarily assist efforts to verify and provide supporting information on unconfirmed health threats in their region. By linking this member network of health experts through a secure online reporting platform, EpiCore enables faster global outbreak detection and reporting.},

Method(s): In this descriptive study, all reported cases in Hamadan Province were extracted. The analytical literature review method was used to examine completeness. We used studies on the prevalence and incidence of hepatitis in Iran published between 2007 and 2013. Sensitivity analysis of the results was performed by simulation program using the R software. Geographical representativeness was assessed and plotted by the ArcGIS software, as well. Result(s): Totally, 1378 cases were reported to the hepatitis B surveillance system in Hamadan Province. Most cases were from urban areas and were men, married, and housewives mostly in the age group 20 to 29 and 30 to 39 years. Completeness of the hepatitis B surveillance system was 77\%. The hepatitis B surveillance system was not representative in terms of occupation but was representative in terms of age, sex, marital status, and place of living. Conclusion(s): We concluded that the hepatitis B surveillance system had a relatively good performance. Moreover, findings of the analytical literature review method are affected by the included studies and interpretation of the results should be performed with caution.Copyright {\copyright} 2015, Iranian Epidemiological Association.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 2008, Somalia introduced an electronic based Early Warning Alert and Response Network (EWARN) for real time detection and response to alerts of epidemic prone diseases in a country experiencing a complex humanitarian situation. EWARN was deactivated between 2008 to 2016 due to civil conflict and reactivated in 2017 during severe drought during a cholera outbreak. We present an assessment of the performance of the EWARN in Somalia from January 2017 to December 2020, reflections on the successes and failures, and provide future perspectives for enhancement of the EWARN to effectively support an Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response strategy., METHODS: We described geographical coverage of the EWARN, system attributes, which included; sensitivity, flexibility, timeliness, data quality (measured by completeness), and positive predictive value (PPV). We tested for trends of timeliness of submission of epidemiological reports across the years using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel stratified test of association., RESULTS: By December 2020, all 6 states and the Banadir Administrative Region were implementing EWARN. In 2017, only 24.6\% of the records were submitted on time, but by 2020, 96.8\% of the reports were timely (p {$<$} 0.001). Completeness averaged {$<$} 60\% in all the 4 years, with the worst-performing year being 2017. Overall, PPV was 14.1\%. Over time, PPV improved from 7.1\% in 2017 to 15.4\% in 2019 but declined to 9.7\% in 2020. Alert verification improved from 2.0\% in 2017 to 52.6\% by 2020, (p {$<$} 0.001). In 2020, EWARN was enhanced to facilitate COVID-19 reporting demonstrating its flexibility to accommodate the integration of reportable diseases., CONCLUSIONS: During the past 4 years of implementing EWARN in Somalia, the system has improved significantly in timeliness, disease alerts verification, and flexibility in responding to emerging disease outbreaks, and enhanced coverage. However, the system is not yet optimal due to incompleteness and lack of integration with other systems suggesting the need to build additional capacity for improved disease surveillance coverage, buttressed by system improvements to enhance data quality and integration.

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Early threat detection and situational awareness are vital to achieving a comprehensive and accurate view of health-related events for federal, state, and local health agencies. Key to this are public health and syndromic surveillance systems that can analyze large data sets to discover patterns, trends, and correlations of public health significance. In 2020, Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) evaluated its public health surveillance system and identified areas for improvement.                                         Methods               Using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Guidelines for Evaluating Public Health Surveillance Systems, we assessed the ability of the Praedico Surveillance System to perform public health surveillance for a variety of health issues and evaluated its performance compared to an enterprise data solution (VA Corporate Data Warehouse), legacy surveillance system (VA ESSENCE) and a national, collaborative syndromic surveillance platform (CDC NSSP BioSense).                                         Results               Review of system attributes found that the system was simple, flexible, and stable. Representativeness, timeliness, sensitivity, and Predictive Value Positive were acceptable but could be further improved. Data quality issues and acceptability present challenges that potentially affect the overall usefulness of the system.                                         Conclusions               Praedico is a customizable surveillance and data analytics platform built on big data technologies. Functionality is straightforward, with rapid query generation and runtimes. Data can be graphed, mapped, analyzed, and shared with key decision makers and stakeholders. Evaluation findings suggest that future development and system enhancements should focus on addressing Praedico data quality issues and improving user acceptability. Because Praedico is designed to handle big data queries and work with data from a variety of sources, it could be enlisted as a tool for interdepartmental and interagency collaboration and public health data sharing. We suggest that future system evaluations include measurements of value and effectiveness along with additional organizations and functional assessments.},

Results: A total of 39 304 alerting signals were generated from 19 kinds of infectious diseases in the system in Zhejiang province with the responding rate of 99.97\% and the median responding time of 1.03 hours. 309 signals (0.79\%) were preliminarily confirmed as suspicious events, and 78 outbreaks were finally confirmed by further site investigation, with a positive alerting rate of 0.20\%. There was a positive correlation between the numbers of reported cases and the time of early-warning (r=0.91, P{$<$}0.05). After adjusting the parameter of CIDARS, the number of signals decreased, while the positive alerting rate increased ({$\chi$}2=4.46, P{$<$}0.05) Conclusions: CIDARS has a good performance which may be used to achieve automatic early alter for outbreak of infectious diseases. The performance of CIDARS might be improved by adjusting the parameter of early-warning model. However, suitable methods should be selected according to the characteristics of diseases.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Brazilian Network for the Surveillance of Severe Maternal Morbidity was developed in Brazil with the participation of 27 centers in different regions of the country. The objective of the network project was to evaluate the frequency of severe maternal morbidity (near-miss and potentially life-threatening conditions) and the factors involved with these clinical conditions. Over the data collection period, this project implemented a surveillance system to identify these cases in the participating institutions. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the perspective of the professionals who participated in this network regarding the surveillance of cases of severe maternal morbidity, the facilities and difficulties encountered in involving colleagues in the process, and participants' proposals to give continuity to this practice of qualifying maternal healthcare., METHODS: A descriptive study with a qualitative approach was conducted in which coordinators, investigators and managers at all the 27 obstetric units participating in the network were interviewed. Data were collected at 6 and 12 months after implementation of the network during semi-structured telephone interviews that were recorded following verbal informed consent. Thematic content analysis was performed of the responses to the open questions in the interviews., RESULTS: In the opinion of 60\% of the participants, involving their colleagues in the surveillance process proved difficult, principally because these professionals were not very interested in the research project, but also because they found it difficult to review concepts and professional practices, because they had an excessive workload or due to operational and technical difficulties. The great majority considered that support from government agencies providing financial resources would be crucial to enable surveillance to be maintained or expanded and also to train a larger number of professionals and improve work conditions. The majority of participants found it difficult to define the ideal time interval at which surveillance should be conducted., CONCLUSION: The investigators, coordinators and managers involved in the Brazilian network project mentioned several problems that had to be confronted during this process; however, in their opinion the project should be maintained and even expanded in view of its potential to contribute towards improving obstetric care.}

Reporting was based on easily recognized signs, symptoms, and sentinel events. Published criteria were used in evaluating surveillance effectiveness, and notifiable disease reporting of participating and nonparticipating facilities was compared., RESULTS: Neither surveillance model was well accepted by child care providers. Enhanced passive and active surveillance had comparable sensitivity. Reporting delays and the large amount of time needed for data entry led to problems with timeliness, especially in terms of written reporting during active surveillance., CONCLUSIONS: Widespread active public health surveillance in child care facilities is not feasible for most local health departments. Improvements in public health surveillance in child care settings will depend on acceptability to providers.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The approach to surveillance of Lyme borreliosis varies between countries, depending on the purpose of the surveillance system and the notification criteria used, which prevents direct comparison of national data. In Norway, Lyme borreliosis is notifiable to the Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases (MSIS). The current notification criteria include a combination of clinical and laboratory results for borrelia infection (excluding Erythema migrans) but there are indications that these criteria are not followed consistently by clinicians and by laboratories. Therefore, an evaluation of Lyme borreliosis surveillance in Norway was conducted to describe the purpose of the system and to assess the suitability of the current notification criteria in order to identify areas for improvement., METHODS: The CDC Guidelines for Evaluation of Surveillance Systems were used to develop the assessment of the data quality, representativeness and acceptability of MSIS for surveillance of Lyme borreliosis. Data quality was assessed through a review of data from 1996 to 2013 in MSIS and a linkage of MSIS data from 2008 to 2012 with data from the Norwegian Patient Registry (NPR). Representativeness and acceptability were assessed through a survey sent to 23 diagnostic laboratories., RESULTS: Completeness of key variables for cases reported to MSIS was high, except for geographical location of exposureThe NPR-MSIS linkage identified 1047 cases in both registries, while 363 were only reported to MSIS and 3914 were only recorded in NPR. A higher proportion of cases found in both registries were recorded as neuroborreliosis in MSIS (84.4 \%) than those cases found only in MSIS (20.1 \%). The trend (average yearly increase or decrease in reported cases) of neuroborreliosis in MSIS was not significantly different from the trend for all other clinical manifestations recorded in MSIS in negative binomial regression (p = 0.3). The 16 surveyed laboratories (response proportion 70 \%) indicated differences in testing practices and low acceptability of the notification criteria., CONCLUSIONS: Given the challenges associated with diagnosing Lyme borreliosis, the selected notification criteria should be closely linked with the purpose of the surveillance system. Restricting reportable Lyme borreliosis to neuroborreliosis may increase validity, while a more sensitive case definition (potentially including erythema migrans) may better reflect the true burden of disease. We recommend revising the current notification criteria in Norway to ensure that they are unambiguous for clinicians and laboratories.},

In 2020, Makonde District failed to detect an anthrax outbreak at one of its facilities, this untimely and poor response of the district increased morbidity. We evaluated the weekly disease surveillance system to determine reasons for missing outbreaks and determine the usefulness of the system in the detection of outbreaks., Methods: we conducted descriptive cross-sectional study using updated Centres for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for surveillance system evaluation. We recruited 46 health workers. A structured pretested interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data on reasons for missing outbreaks, knowledge, usefulness and surveillance system attributes. Data were cleaned and bivariate analysis was conducted., Results: health workers found the system simple (85\%), acceptable (75\%) and flexible (60\%). However, we found only 5 (11\%) health workers could correctly describe the surveillance system, only 2 (3\%) were trained in disease surveillance, only 31 (65\%) sent data on time, 57\% of clinics had stock outs of forms, 60\% of forms had entries with 100\% of the data filled out and 22 (46\%) of health workers analysed the data gathered and used it in meetings., Conclusion: the surveillance system was simple, flexible, acceptable, but unstable, untimely and not useful. There was poor knowledge on the surveillance system, health workers were not trained on disease surveillance, and quality of data was poor. Health workers should be trained in surveillance and data validation and adequate reporting tools provided. Copyright: Kudzai Madamombe et al.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mass gatherings (MGs; eg, religious, sporting, musical, sociocultural, and other occasions that draw large crowds) pose public health challenges and concerns related to global health. A leading global concern regarding MGs is the possible importation and exportation of infectious diseases as they spread from the attendees to the general population, resulting in epidemic outbreaks. Governments and health authorities use technological interventions to support public health surveillance and prevent and control infectious diseases., OBJECTIVE: This study aims to review the evidence on the effectiveness of public health digital surveillance systems for infectious disease prevention and control at MG events., METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in January 2022 using the Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Scopus databases to examine relevant articles published in English up to January 2022. Interventional studies describing or evaluating the effectiveness of public health digital surveillance systems for infectious disease prevention and control at MGs were included in the analysis. Owing to the lack of appraisal tools for interventional studies describing and evaluating public health digital surveillance systems at MGs, a critical appraisal tool was developed and used to assess the quality of the included studies., RESULTS: In total, 8 articles were included in the review, and 3 types of MGs were identified: religious (the Hajj and Prayagraj Kumbh), sporting (the Olympic and Paralympic Games, the Federation International Football Association World Cup, and the Micronesian Games), and cultural (the Festival of Pacific Arts) events. In total, 88\% (7/8) of the studies described surveillance systems implemented at MG events, and 12\% (1/8) of the studies described and evaluated an enhanced surveillance system that was implemented for an event. In total, 4 studies reported the implementation of a surveillance system: 2 (50\%) described the enhancement of the system that was implemented for an event, 1 (25\%) reported a pilot implementation of a surveillance system, and 1 (25\%) reported an evaluation of an enhanced system. The types of systems investigated were 2 syndromic, 1 participatory, 1 syndromic and event-based, 1 indicator- and event-based, and 1 event-based surveillance system. In total, 62\% (5/8) of the studies reported timeliness as an outcome generated after implementing or enhancing the system without measuring its effectiveness. Only 12\% (1/8) of the studies followed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for evaluating public health surveillance systems and the outcomes of enhanced systems based on the systems' attributes to measure their effectiveness., CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the review of the literature and the analysis of the included studies, there is limited evidence of the effectiveness of public health digital surveillance systems for infectious disease prevention and control at MGs because of the absence of evaluation studies.

In the European Economic Area, the surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in zoonotic pathogens and indicator bacteria in healthy food-producing animals is required legally, while countries are also expected to extend their surveillance to diseased animals in the frame of national action plans. In this context, evaluating existing antimicrobial resistance surveillance systems in animal health is important to improve systems in place, but also to help other countries learn from these experiences, understand success factors and anticipate challenges. With this aim, the French surveillance network for antimicrobial resistance in bacteria from diseased animals (RESAPATH) was evaluated using the Outil d'Analyse des Systemes d'Information en Sante (OASIS) assessment tool. Key performance factors included (i) a strong and inclusive central institutional organisation defining clear and well-accepted surveillance objectives, scope and procedures, (ii) strong skills in epidemiology and microbiology and (iii) a win-win approach enabling the voluntary participation of 71 field laboratories and where free annual proficiency testing plays a pivotal role. The main area for improvement of RESAPATH was its time-consuming data management system.},

  abstract = {Two vector borne diseases, caused by the Bluetongue and Schmallenberg viruses respectively, have emerged in the European ruminant populations since 2006. Several diseases are transmitted by the same vectors and could emerge in the future. Syndromic surveillance, which consists in the routine monitoring of indicators for the detection of adverse health events, may allow an early detection. Milk yield is routinely measured in a large proportion of dairy herds and could be incorporated as an indicator in a surveillance system. However, few studies have evaluated continuous indicators for syndromic surveillance. The aim of this study was to develop a framework for the quantification of both disease characteristics and model predictive abilities that are important for a continuous indicator to be sensitive, timely and specific for the detection of a vector-borne disease emergence. Emergences with a range of spread characteristics and effects on milk production were simulated. Milk yields collected monthly in 48 713 French dairy herds were used to simulate 576 disease emergence scenarios. First, the effect of disease characteristics on the sensitivity and timeliness of detection were assessed: Spatio-temporal clusters of low milk production were detected with a scan statistic using the difference between observed and simulated milk yields as input. In a second step, the system specificity was evaluated by running the scan statistic on the difference between observed and predicted milk yields, in the absence of simulated emergence. The timeliness of detection depended mostly on how easily the disease spread between and within herds. The time and location of the emergence or adding random noise to the simulated effects had a limited impact on the timeliness of detection. The main limitation of the system was the low specificity i.e. the high number of clusters detected from the difference between observed and predicted productions, in the absence of disease.}

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is an uncommon autoimmune disorder that follows infection or vaccination, and increased incidence has been reported during Zika virus (ZIKV) transmission. During the 2016 ZIKV epidemic, the Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDH) implemented the Enhanced GBS Surveillance System (EGBSSS). Here, we describe EGBSSS implementation and evaluate completeness, validity, and timeliness., METHODS: GBS cases were identified using passive surveillance and discharge diagnostic code for GBS. Completeness was evaluated by capture-recapture methods. Sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) for confirmed GBS cases were calculated for both case identification methods. Median time to completion of key time steps were compared by quarter (Q1-4) and hospital size., RESULTS: A total of 122 confirmed GBS cases with onset of neurologic illness in 2016 were identified. Capture-recapture methodology estimated that four confirmed GBS cases were missed by both identification methods. Identification of cases by diagnostic code had a higher sensitivity than passive surveillance (89\% vs. 80\%), but a lower PPV (60\% vs. 72\%). There was a significant decrease from Q1 to Q3 in median time from hospital admission to case reporting (11 days vs. 2 days, p = 0.032) and from Q2 to Q3 in median time from specimen receipt to arbovirus laboratory test reporting (35 days vs. 26 days, p = 0.004)., CONCLUSION: EGBSSS provided complete, valid, and increasingly timely surveillance data, which guided public health action and supported healthcare providers during the ZIKV epidemic. This evaluation provides programmatic lessons for GBS surveillance and emergency response surveillance.},

Gokwe North district with an estimated 119 655 children {$<$}15 years detected 2 cases, 4 cases and 1 case of AFP in 2012, 2013 and 2014 respectively against a target of 5 cases per year. We therefore set out to evaluate the system and find out why it was failing to detect at least 5 cases per year., METHODS: A descriptive cross sectional study was carried out. All three hospitals in the district were purposively selected. Twelve of the nineteen health facilities were randomly selected and forty nine health workers were purposively recruited. An interviewer administered questionnaire and key informant interview guide were used to collect data. Quantitative data was analysed using Epi info., RESULTS: Out of the 49 respondents, 17(34.7\%) knew the target age group for AFP surveillance. Twelve (24.5\%) knew the number of notification forms to be filled. Seven (14.3\%) and ten (20.4\%) respondents knew when to follow up an AFP case and when an AFP case should be followed up and completely notified and investigated respectively. Forty one (83.7\%) respondents were not trained on AFP surveillance. Nineteen (39\%) had AFP notification forms at the clinic and 33(67\%) had displayed AFP case definitions. All the 22 health facilities in the district participate in AFP surveillance; however, all have hard to reach areas. Seventeen (34.7\%) reportedly took public health actions based on AFP data., CONCLUSION: The system was found to be useful, simple, acceptable, timely, unstable, not representative and not sensitive. The system was threatened by lack of health worker knowledge and community active search. Advocacy, communication and social mobilization on AFP surveillance might improve the performance of the system in Gokwe North district.},

During period 2017-2020, Kwekwe city, with an estimated population of 117,116, detected one case of suspected measles. This was against a target of 2 cases per year. We evaluated the system to establish why it was failing to detect at least 2 cases per year., Methods: we conducted a descriptive cross-sectional study using the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) Updated Guidelines. Nineteen health facilities were selected and fifty-seven health workers were randomly recruited. An interviewer-administered questionnaire and checklists were used to collect data. We generated frequencies, proportions, and means., Results: the mean years in service was 22.8 years (SD=12.6). Thirty (52.6\%) respondents had fair knowledge. Fourteen (73.7\%) of the nineteen respondents who had ever completed case investigation forms took between 10-20 minutes to complete. Only two (10.5\%) of the nineteen facilities had case investigation forms. The majority of the respondents 54 (93\%) were willing to continue participating in the measles Community Base Surveillance System (CBSS). None of the health facilities had used the system to inform decision-making. Reasons highlighted for poor suspected measles case detection included lack of health worker training 28/57 (49.1\%)., Conclusion: despite the high age in service, knowledge of the surveillance system was mostly fair. The system was found to be simple, not stable and not useful. The main reason for the system failure was lack of health worker training.

A case-synthesis review of environmental regulatory and public health indicator models was employed to develop a framework and outline a methodological approach to EPH surveillance system development, including the selection of content areas and the corresponding data and environmental public health indicators. The framework is organized around three assessment phases: (1) scientific basis and relevance, (2) analytic soundness, and (3) feasibility, interpretation and utility. By outlining a process and identifying important constructs and criteria, the framework provides practitioners with an effective and systematic tool for making scientifically valid programmatic decisions about EPH content development.

  abstract = {Background: Noma (cancrum oris) is a devastating gangrenous disease that leads to severe tissue destruction in the face and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. It is seen almost exclusively in young children living in remote areas of less developed countries, particularly in Africa. The exact prevalence of the disease is unknown, but a conservative estimate is that 770,000 people are currently affected by Noma sequelae. The main purpose of this evaluation is to describe the various attributes of the system and determine whether the system is meeting its set public health objectives or not. We evaluate the performance of the Noma IDSR surveillance system in Zamfara State. Methods \& Materials: A retrospective study design conducted in January 2019 using CDC guideline on surveillance system evaluation and key informant interviews among stakeholders involved in disease reporting through the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) system. Univariate analysis of Noma surveillance data (2014-2018) was done to get frequencies and proportions. Result(s): Out of 42 respondents, 89.8\% said the surveillance system is simple, and funded by government. The IDSR system has formal sources of information and flow. Case definition used is highly sensitive but requires complex laboratory confirmation. System captures age, sex as socio-demographic. Out of the 98 cases recorded for the period of five years (2014-2018), 96 (97.8\%) cases were in 2015 with one death from the same year. The data showed that a majority of cases were from the communities bordering Sokoto State. Conclusion(s): The IDSR system has a high degree of acceptability among stakeholders because forms are understandable and easy to fill. Generally, the Noma Surveillance System in Zamfara State is simple and flexible. It is stable, representative, and acceptable to stakeholders. The evaluation revealed that the surveillance system was meeting its objectives.Copyright {\copyright} 2020},

  abstract = {Objective: To evaluate vector surveillance at municipal and county levels in Hebei province, China, and to find out quality problems in the surveillance work to guide the improvement of surveillance work and its quality in Hebei province. Methods: The vector surveillance specimens from 57 municipal and county quality control points were checked, and the compliance rate of surveillance data was calculated. The scores of 8 quality evaluation indicators of each quality control point were quantified, and the t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Friedman Q-test were used to analyze the compliance level of monitoring. Results: In Hebei province, the mean compliance rate of rodent surveillance data was (80.95{\textpm}40.07)\% at the municipal level and (78.06{\textpm}28.50)\% at the county level. For mosquito surveillance data, the mean compliance rate was (77.84{\textpm}27.76)\% at the municipal level and (83.03{\textpm}26.09)\% at the county level. For fly surveillance data, the mean compliance rate was (84.27{\textpm}11.67)\% at the municipal level and (73.75{\textpm}25.93)\% at the county level. For cockroach surveillance data, the mean compliance rate was (95.59{\textpm}8.53)\% at the municipal level and (85.99{\textpm}18.03)\% at the county level. There were no significant differences in the compliance rates of the surveillance data of four vectors between the municipal level and county level (P {$>$} 0.05). All 8 indicators reached the level of "relatively good" or higher at the municipal level, and 7 indicators at the county level. Both municipal and county quality control points had high scores in 4 indicators-the completion rate of surveillance points, the stability of surveillance personnel, the timeliness of reports, and the compliance rate of surveillance tools. The indicators to be improved for the municipal level were the standardization of report filling (3.09{\textpm}0.80 points), the compliance rate of surveillance habitats (3.32{\textpm}0.81 points), the compliance rate of surveillance data (3.46{\textpm}1.06 points), and the compliance rate of surveillance time (3.64{\textpm}0.98 points). The indicators to be improved for the county level were the compliance rate of surveillance data (2.94{\textpm}1.79 points), the standardization of report filling (3.11{\textpm}1.00 points), the compliance rate of surveillance habitats (3.30{\textpm}1.32 points), and the compliance rate of surveillance time (3.46{\textpm}1.11 points). Conclusion: The overall quality of vector surveillance is good both at municipal and county levels in Hebei province, but quality control points at the same level show mixed surveillance qualities. Both municipal and county points should make up for the weak links to improve surveillance quality.},

  abstract = {SETTING: Despite the low incidence of tuberculosis (TB) in the United States military, there is uncertainty in the overall reporting and estimates of incidence. OBJECTIVE: To assess TB reporting in the active component US military. DESIGN: TB notification in the US military was compared with three other data sources: laboratory, hospitalization and pharmacy records. Sensitivity and positive predictive value were estimated for all data sources using a gold standard of either a reportable medical event (RME) reported as confirmed or a positive laboratory result for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Uncorrected and capture-recapture (CR) methods were used to estimate underreporting and completeness of data sources. RESULTS: Completeness of reporting of pulmonary TB cases was estimated as 72.4\% uncorrected or 58.3\% with CR. Even after correction for possible underreporting, the incidence of active pulmonary TB was only 0.87 per 100 000 person-years between 2004 and 2006. CONCLUSION: The rate of active TB in the US military is low. Like civilian surveillance, US military RME surveillance may substantially underreport TB incidence rates. Expanding surveillance to include data sources such as hospitalizations and pharmacy records will increase the number of TB diagnoses at the cost of including many false-positives. {\copyright} 2010 The Union.},

The objectives of this study were to assess the validity of the surveillance case definition used by the Medical Surveillance Monthly Report (MSMR) for HCV, the over and underestimation of cases from surveillance data, and the true burden of HCV disease in the U.S. military. This was a validation study of all potential HCV cases in the active component U.S. military from calendar year 2019 obtained using several different data sources: 1) outpatient, inpatient, and reportable medical event (RME) records in the Defense Medical Surveillance System, 2) Health Level 7 (HL7) laboratory data obtained from the Navy Marine Corps Public Health Center, and 3) chart review of the electronic medical records of all potential HCV cases, to include those from privately-sourced care. The sensitivity of the MSMR case definition was 83.6\% and the positive predictive value (PPV) was 60.0\%. This study suggests that the U.S. military should have confidence that the previous estimates derived using the MSMR surveillance case definition were moderately close to the true burden of incident chronic HCV infection (the true incidence of chronic disease being about 27\% lower), but these reports likely dramatically overestimate the incidence of acute HCV. Since HCV was selected as an RME to guide public health action, it is most suitable to invest public health efforts in strengthening the use of confirmed RMEs as the surveillance case definition.},

Objective: To evaluate the performance of the Colombian public health surveillance system during the first 50 days of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country. Materials and methods: We analyzed the data published between March 6 and April 24, 2020, by the Instituto Nacional de Salud and the World Health Organization (WHO). We evaluated: i) the quality of the data according to the fulfillment of Benford's law, and ii) the timeliness of the information measured as the difference in dates between the data generated by the Instituto Nacional de Salud and WHO's situational reports. We assessed the fulfillment of Benford's law using the p values of the log-likelihood ratio, the chi square or Moreno's exact tests. Results: Until April 24 there were 4,881 cases of COVID-19 in Colombia. During most of the first 50 days of the pandemic, Benford's law was fulfilled except the first days of the epidemic. The difference between Instituto Nacional de Salud and WHO reports largely depends on the different reporting times. Conclusion: In general, the Colombian public health surveillance system fulfilled Benford's law suggesting that there was quality in the data.

It includes representatives from the public and private sectors. The aim of the study is to evaluate the national SARI sentinel surveillance system in Kuwait. Method(s): The evaluation of the SARI sentinel surveillance system covers the period between April 2016 and May 2018 at the two sentinel sites active at the time. CDC guidelines for evaluation of surveillance systems were used and nine attributes considered for evaluation. The score of each attribute was calculated and averaged to determine the final score value. Result(s): During the evaluation period, 2375 SARI cases were reported from the two sentinel sites. Mean scores for the nine attributes for evaluation were calculated. Data quality and completeness scored 3, signaling good performance. Acceptability, stability, sustainability, and utility were also good. Scores for timeliness, representativeness, simplicity, and flexibility indicated moderate performance and require improvement. The overall score was 2.5, representing good performance. Conclusion(s): The SARI surveillance system in Kuwait performs well and provides a reliable data source for public health interventions. To enhance performance staff numbers and training were increased and a new sentinel site added in a third district.},

We evaluated EWARS in the remote West Papua province of Indonesia., Methods: Structured telephone interviews were conducted with 11 key informants from West Papuan health services. EWARS data were analysed for usefulness of reporting., Results: Most respondents reported that EWARS is important and useful in improving early detection of outbreaks. The system has led to increased disease control coordination among health jurisdictional levels in the province. However, respondents noted that the limited number of districts involved in the system affected representativeness, and some stated that only about 30-35\% of districts in each regency were involved and trained in EWARS reporting, partly owing to lack of a mobile telephone network. Barriers to complete reporting and response to alerts included limited human and funding resources for surveillance, lack of epidemiological training, and technical limitations imposed by limited internet and mobile communication infrastructure in this remote region., Conclusion: Great progress has been made in integrating West Papua into a nationally consistent disease and outbreak detection system. Strategies for addressing barriers resulting from remoteness, constrained human, funding and laboratory resources, lack of training, and limited internet and communications infrastructure are needed if EWARS in West Papua is to advance.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Maternal Death Surveillance and Response (MDSR) system was established to provide information that effectively guides actions to eliminate preventable maternal mortality. In 2016, Hwange district sent six maternal death notification forms (MDNF) to the province without maternal death audit reports. Timeliness of MDNF reaching the province is a challenge. Two MDNF for deaths that occurred in February and May 2016 only reached the provincial office in September 2016 meaning the MDNF were seven and four months late respectively. We evaluated the MDSR system in Hwange district., METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted. Health workers in the sampled facilities were interviewed using questionnaires. Resource availability was assessed through checklists. Epi Info 7 was used to calculate frequencies, means and proportions., RESULTS: We recruited 36 respondents from 11 facilities, 72.2\% were females. Inadequate health worker knowledge, lack of induction on MDSR, unavailability of guidelines and notification forms and lack of knowledge on the flow of information in the system were reasons for late notification of maternal deaths. Workers trained in MDSR were 83.8\%. Only 36.1\% of respondents had completed an MDNF before. Respondents who used MDSR data at their level were 91.7\%, and they reported that MDSR system was useful. Responsibility to complete the MDNF was placed on health workers. Maternal death case definitions were available in 2/11 facilities, 4/11 facilities had guidelines for maternal death audits. It costs \$60.78 to notify a maternal death., CONCLUSION: Reasons for late notification of maternal deaths were inadequate knowledge, lack of induction, unavailability of guidelines and notification forms at facilities. The MDSR system is useful, acceptable, flexible, unstable, reliable but not simple. Maternal case definitions and maternal death audit guidelines should be distributed to all facilities. Training of all health workers involved in MDSR is recommended.},

  abstract = {The 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to recommend countries to establish a national severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) surveillance system for preparedness and emergency response. However, setting up or maintaining a robust SARI surveillance system has been challenging. Similar to other countries, surveillance data on hospitalisations for SARI in the Netherlands are still limited, in contrast to the robust surveillance data in primary care. The objective of this narrative review is to provide an overview, evaluation, and challenges of already available surveillance systems or datasets in the Netherlands, which might be used for near real-time surveillance of severe respiratory infections. Seven available surveillance systems or datasets in the Netherlands were reviewed. The evaluation criteria, including data quality, timeliness, representativeness, simplicity, flexibility, acceptability and stability were based on United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) guidelines for public health surveillance. We added sustainability as additional evaluation criterion. The best evaluated surveillance system or dataset currently available for SARI surveillance is crude mortality monitoring, although it lacks specificity. In contrast to influenza-like illness (ILI) in primary care, there is currently no gold standard for SARI surveillance in the Netherlands. Based on our experience with sentinel SARI surveillance, a fully or semi-automated, passive surveillance system seems most suited for a sustainable SARI surveillance system. An important future challenge remains integrating SARI surveillance into existing hospital programs in order to make surveillance data valuable for public health, as well as hospital quality of care management and individual patient care.

  abstract = {West Nile virus (WNV) is endemic in the Po valley area in northern Italy. Regional health authorities have implemented integrated WNV surveillance following a One Health approach, based on collaboration between human, animal and environmental health institutions. We evaluated this integrated WNV surveillance system in Emilia-Romagna, Lombardy and Piedmont regions by means of a process evaluation. We examined the system's implementation fidelity, dose delivered and received, reach, and we identified strengths and weaknesses in the system. Qualitative and semi-quantitative data were obtained from three regional focus groups. Data were discussed in a follow up focus group, where participants suggested recommendations for improving the surveillance system. Inter-institutional and interdisciplinary integration and the creation of a 'community of practice' were identified as key elements for effective surveillance. We identified differences in the degree of interdisciplinary integration in the three regions, likely due to different epidemiological situations and years of experience in surveillance implementation. Greater collaboration and sharing of information, public engagement and economic assessments of the integrated surveillance approach would facilitate its social recognition and guarantee its sustainability through dedicated funding. We demonstrate that a transdisciplinary research approach based on process evaluation has value for designing and fine-tuning integrated health surveillance systems.

  abstract = {In recent years, biosurveillance has become the buzzword under which a diverse set of ideas and activities regarding detecting and mitigating biological threats are incorporated depending on context and perspective. Increasingly, biosurveillance practice has become global and interdisciplinary, requiring information and resources across public health, One Health, and biothreat domains. Even within the scope of infectious disease surveillance, multiple systems, data sources, and tools are used with varying and often unknown effectiveness. Evaluating the impact and utility of state-of-the-art biosurveillance is, in part, confounded by the complexity of the systems and the information derived from them. We present a novel approach conceptualizing biosurveillance from the perspective of the fundamental data streams that have been or could be used for biosurveillance and to systematically structure a framework that can be universally applicable for use in evaluating and understanding a wide range of biosurveillance activities. Moreover, the Biosurveillance Data Stream Framework and associated definitions are proposed as a starting point to facilitate the development of a standardized lexicon for biosurveillance and characterization of currently used and newly emerging data streams. Criteria for building the data stream framework were developed from an examination of the literature, analysis of information on operational infectious disease biosurveillance systems, and consultation with experts in the area of biosurveillance. To demonstrate utility, the framework and definitions were used as the basis for a schema of a relational database for biosurveillance resources and in the development and use of a decision support tool for data stream evaluation.},

It is of vital importance for protecting and improving the livelihoods of diverse groups of livestock keepers and stakeholders in livestock value chains. Surveillance systems consist of sets of complementary components which generate information to inform risk assessment, decision-making and policy formulation for both national programmes and international trade. Participatory approaches have the potential to add value to surveillance systems by enhancing their performance, especially their sensitivity and timeliness, and encouraging the inclusion of marginalised groups. This paper summarises key considerations in the assessment and design of animal health surveillance and discusses how participatory approaches can be integrated into comprehensive surveillance systems, leading to a more effective overall outcome for both domestic and international purposes.},

  abstract = {Australia's Enhanced Invasive Pneumococcal Disease Surveillance Program is part of the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System, and is coordinated by the Enhanced Invasive Pneumococcal Disease Surveillance Working Group (EIPDSWG). This first evaluation of the surveillance program aimed to evaluate its performance against a number of attributes, identify ways in which surveillance may be improved, and make recommendations to the EIPDSWG. We conducted literature and document reviews; key informant interviews; an online stakeholder survey; and descriptive analyses of a subset of surveillance data. The program is complex, but has proved useful for detecting serotype replacement in response to the national infant vaccination program-informing a change to the recommended vaccine in 2011. The program is less useful for monitoring targeted programs in other high-risk groups, because complete data for cases aged between five and 50 years are not routinely collected in the largest jurisdictions and data collection is hampered by the absence of accessible electronic health records. Lack of support for reference laboratories for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and data entry and transmission problems in some jurisdictions, have reduced the utility of the program for surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Priority recommendations to the EIPDSWG focus on collecting complete data for all cases, to allow matching of serotypes to vaccines and surveillance of vaccine failures, while ensuring stakeholders can easily access useful surveillance data at the level of detail they require. Efforts should also be made to improve AMR data completeness, and to explore the feasibility of whole-genome sequencing methods for monitoring resistance. This work is copyright.

However, the surveillance needs to be evaluated and be able to detect the disease with speed and sensitivity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the epidemiological situation of rabies and the surveillance system and propose a restructure on a risk-based surveillance strategy. The epidemiological situation was descriptively assessed. The evaluation was performed according to the evaluation guidelines for surveillance systems in public health from the US Center for Disease Control (CDC). The proposed restructure was performed by building scenario trees of the system sensitivity and a proposition, with probability calculations, of sampling to maximize this sensitivity. The evaluation of the epidemiological situation showed no cases of human rabies between 2003 and 2013, cases in dogs and cats were sporadic, dispersed in time and space and occasioned by AgV-3 and AgV-4, cases not reported by AgV-2 for over ten years. For dogs and cats, surveillance was dependent on the specific structure of the local services to send brain samples to laboratories (low simplicity). Private veterinarians had low participation and perception of the system (low acceptability). The area unattended in dogs grew 30\% between 2003 and 2013 (low representativeness). Getting dogs with symptoms associated with rabies, 39\% of local and 72\% of private veterinarians not suspected of rabies in 2012 (low sensitivity). The time between onset of symptoms and laboratory results from dogs suspected in 2012 and 2013 was on average 25 days (low timeliness). The indicators have shown that the system has low ability to disease detect early. If the sampling efforts for surveillance in dogs were directed to animals with neurological symptoms (even the nonspecific of rabies), a joint action between private veterinarians and local services of zoonoses controls, the system sensitivity could reach the its maximum, using the structure of existing laboratory diagnosis.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Uganda is a low income country that continues to experience disease outbreaks caused by emerging and re-emerging diseases such as cholera, meningococcal meningitis, typhoid and viral haemorrhagic fevers. The Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy was adopted by WHO-AFRO in 1998 as a comprehensive strategy to improve disease surveillance and response in WHO Member States in Africa and was adopted in Uganda in 2000. To address persistent inconsistencies and inadequacies in the core and support functions of IDSR, Uganda initiated an IDSR revitalisation programme in 2012. The objective of this evaluation was to assess IDSR core and support functions after implementation of the revitalised IDSR programme., METHODS: The evaluation was a cross-sectional survey that employed mixed quantitative and qualitative methods. We assessed IDSR performance indicators, knowledge acquisition, knowledge retention and level of confidence in performing IDSR tasks among health workers who underwent IDSR training. Qualitative data was collected to guide the interpretation of quantitative findings and to establish a range of views related to IDSR implementation., RESULTS: Between 2012 and 2016, there was an improvement in completeness of monthly reporting (69 to 100\%) and weekly reporting (56 to 78\%) and an improvement in timeliness of monthly reporting (59 to 93\%) and weekly reporting (40 to 68\%) at the national level. The annualised non-polio AFP rate increased from 2.8 in 2012 to 3.7 cases per 100,000 population {$<$} 15 years in 2016. The case fatality rate for cholera decreased from 3.2\% in 2012 to 2.1\% in 2016. All districts received IDSR feedback from the national level. Key IDSR programme challenges included inadequate numbers of trained staff, inadequate funding, irregular supervision and high turnover of trained staff. Recommendations to improve IDSR performance included: improving funding, incorporating IDSR training into pre-service curricula for health workers and strengthening support supervision., CONCLUSION: The revitalised IDSR programme in Uganda was associated with improvements in performance. However in 2016, the programme still faced significant challenges and some performance indicators were still below the target. It is important that the documented gains are consolidated and challenges are continuously identified and addressed as they emerge.},

In South Africa the case-based measles surveillance was initiated in 1998 in line with the recommendation from the World Health Organization (WHO) to monitor progress towards measles elimination. Blood specimens are collected from suspected measles cases at all health facilities at district and provincial level. This study described the epidemiology of measles in South Africa from 2009-2013 and evaluated seven specific performance indicators for measles surveillance recommended by the WHO. METHODS A retrospective descriptive analysis was conducted on secondary measles surveillance data routinely collected from measles suspected cases in all age groups from 2009-2013.The blood samples were tested at the measles serology laboratory at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD). The percentage for each of the indicators was calculated and compared with the WHO minimum standard values for measles surveillance. RESULTS In 2009-2011, there were 18 000 confirmed measles cases reported, which included cases identified during the measles outbreak from June 2009 to July 2010 in all nine provinces. The number of cases decreased to 335 between 2011- 2013. From 2009-2013 the age group most affected were those {$>$}14 years, while the least affected were those between the ages of 2-4 years. Out of the seven performance indicators evaluated, five met WHO specified targets, including all districts reporting at least one measles case per year (WHO target {$>$}=80\% of the districts) and blood specimens collected in more than 80\%of the suspected measles cases (WHO target of {$>$}=80\%).Two laboratory indicators did not meet the WHO targets; between 2009 and 2013, 32\%, 28\%, 46\%, 49\% and 52\% of blood specimens respectively reached the laboratory within 3 days of being sent (WHO target {$>$}=80\%) and between 2009 to 2013,14\%,15\%,65\%, 68\% and 66\% of blood samples respectively were tested within seven days (WHO target {$>$}=80\%). CONCLUSION The case-based measles surveillance met most of the WHO-specified performance indicators. Addressing timeliness of specimen delivery to the laboratory, timeliness of laboratory testing and subsequent feedback of the results to the health facility will ensure proper management of cases and rapid response to outbreaks.}

  abstract = {Syndromic surveillance was performed during the G8 Summit held in Fukuoka and Miyazaki City in July 2000. Any case suspected as acute infectious disease was reported from designated medical facilities. Those cases were categorized in 5 clusters including "hemorrhagic and skin symptoms", "respiratory symptoms", "gastroenteric symptoms", "neural symptoms", and "miscellaneous symptoms". To compare how closely these incidence trends were representing those of the infectious disease surveillance, these results were analyzed for two weeks. In Miyazaki, duplicated report were accepted when more than one symptom were found. The ratio of weekly reported number for each cluster was calculated for two weeks, and then the ratio for former/latter week was calculated for each cluster. The results from Fukuoka and Miyazaki surveillance revealed the average former/latter ratio +/- SD = 0.99 +/- 0.292, 95\% CI; 0.71-1.28 and 1.19 +/- 0.298, 0.93-1.45, respectively. These results indicate that syndromic surveillance is well represented with the infectious disease surveillance trends. Single reporting, employed in Fukuoka, was easier for analysis. Reported number for acute respiratory syndrome was larger than that of infectious disease surveillance, indicating that the latter could not detect non-reportable adult cases. Syndromic surveillance enables us to show the trend quickly and it can be carried out with smaller costs and human resources. This study concluded that a syndromic surveillance is effective for such high-profile events, but sometimes it is hard to analyze the trend accurately, because of insufficient period of baseline data, number and size of the reporting sentinel facilities.},

  abstract = {The factors influencing the promptness of reporting infectious diseases in Jinan City, Shandong, China, and the measures to improve promptness were investigated. The report cards of infectious diseases reported by the Report and Management System of Disease Surveillance Information in 2007 were analysed. 33{\enspace}457 cases were reported in the city, with an average reporting time of 0.09 day. The medical institutions reported cases mostly during 08.30-11.00 or 14.00-17.00 h, accounting for 76.96\% of the total reports. Majority of the report verifications (52.18\%) were performed in the Center for Disease Control at 08.30-11.00 and 14.00-17.00 h. The promptness of infectious disease report was 99.80\% in 2007, and that of verification was 99.90\%. The highest promptness rate for reporting was 100\% in Zhangqiu City, and the lowest was 98.61\% in Zhangqing District. The highest promptness rate for verification was 100\% in Huaiyin District, Tianqiao District and Zhangqiu City, and the lowest was 99.21\% in Licheng District. It is concluded that network reporting of infectious disease is very timely and accurate. However, there are significant differences in the quality of reporting among counties. It is required to establish agents specifically responsible for network reporting, management of epidemics, and timely reporting and verification of report cards to promote report quality in Jinan City.}

  abstract = {Background: The increasing cancer burden remains a public health challenge. Quality and accurate population data is important to improve cancer control, screening, and treatment programmes for the sub-Saharan Africa region. Aim(s): The aim of this study was to establish hospital-based cancer surveillance system, thereby reporting the burden that cancer diagnosis and treatment place on 3 hospitals - an approach of health systems strengthening. Method(s): A hospital-based cancer surveillance was established in 3 public health facilities that provide oncology services in KwaZulu-Natal. An active method was used for finding cancer cases. The cancer surveillance database was evaluated according to the criteria recommended for cancer registries. Analyses of data included descriptive and crude incidence rates. Result(s): A total of 2307 newly diagnosed cancer cases were reported in 2018, with a majority from Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central hospital (65.3\%), followed by Greys hospital (30.8\%) and then Addington hospital (3.94\%). Most of the cancer cases were from the 2 major urban areas of the province (eThekwini and uMgungundlovu district). The most commonly diagnosed cancers from all combined 3 facilities for both sexes were breast, cervix, colorectal, Kaposi Sarcoma, and lung. Approximately half of the cancer cases had no staging, and 12.8\% of the cases were diagnosed at stage 4. The mostly prescribed treatments for the patients were radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Conclusion(s): Based on our hospital-based surveillance, cancer burden is high in the 3 facilities. Strengthening cancer screening and diagnostic policies and procedures that will allow expansion of accurate cancer surveillance system is essential in KwaZulu-Natal and South Africa as a whole.Copyright {\copyright} The Author(s) 2021.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Syndromic surveillance systems can potentially be used to detect a bioterrorist attack earlier than traditional surveillance, by virtue of their near real-time analysis of relevant data. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis using the area under the curve (AUC) as a comparison metric has been recommended as a practical evaluation tool for syndromic surveillance systems, yet traditional ROC curves do not account for timeliness of detection or subsequent time-dependent health outcomes., METHODS: Using a decision-analytic approach, we predicted outcomes, measured in lives, quality adjusted life years (QALYs), and costs, for a series of simulated bioterrorist attacks. We then evaluated seven detection algorithms applied to syndromic surveillance data using outcomes-weighted ROC curves compared to simple ROC curves and timeliness-weighted ROC curves. We performed sensitivity analyses by varying the model inputs between best and worst case scenarios and by applying different methods of AUC calculation., RESULTS: The decision analytic model results indicate that if a surveillance system was successful in detecting an attack, and measures were immediately taken to deliver treatment to the population, the lives, QALYs and dollars lost could be reduced considerably. The ROC curve analysis shows that the incorporation of outcomes into the evaluation metric has an important effect on the apparent performance of the surveillance systems. The relative order of performance is also heavily dependent on the choice of AUC calculation method., CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the importance of accounting for mortality, morbidity and costs in the evaluation of syndromic surveillance systems. Incorporating these outcomes into the ROC curve analysis allows for more accurate identification of the optimal method for signaling a possible bioterrorist attack. In addition, the parameters used to construct an ROC curve should be given careful consideration.}

  abstract = {Background Public health evaluation methods have been criticized for being overly reductionist and failing to generate suitable evidence for public health decision-making. A ``complex systems approach'' has been advocated to account for real world complexity. Qualitative methods may be well suited to understanding change in complex social environments, but guidance on applying a complex systems approach to inform qualitative research remains limited and underdeveloped. This systematic review aims to analyze published examples of process evaluations that utilize qualitative methods that involve a complex systems perspective and proposes a framework for qualitative complex system process evaluations. Methods and findings We conducted a systematic search to identify complex system process evaluations that involve qualitative methods by searching electronic databases from January 1, 2014--September 30, 2019 (Scopus, MEDLINE, Web of Science), citation searching, and expert consultations. Process evaluations were included if they self-identified as taking a systems- or complexity-oriented approach, integrated qualitative methods, reported empirical findings, and evaluated public health interventions. Two reviewers independently assessed each study to identify concepts associated with the systems thinking and complexity science traditions. Twenty-one unique studies were identified evaluating a wide range of public health interventions in, for example, urban planning, sexual health, violence prevention, substance use, and community transformation. Evaluations were conducted in settings such as schools, workplaces, and neighborhoods in 13 different countries (9 high-income and 4 middle-income). All reported some utilization of complex systems concepts in the analysis of qualitative data. In 14 evaluations, the consideration of complex systems influenced intervention design, evaluation planning, or fieldwork. The identified studies used systems concepts to depict and describe a system at one point in time. Only 4 evaluations explicitly utilized a range of complexity concepts to assess changes within the system resulting from, or co-occurring with, intervention implementation over time. Limitations to our approach are including only English-language papers, reliance on study authors reporting their utilization of complex systems concepts, and subjective judgment from the reviewers relating to which concepts featured in each study. Conclusion This study found no consensus on what bringing a complex systems perspective to public health process evaluations with qualitative methods looks like in practice and that many studies of this nature describe static systems at a single time point. We suggest future studies use a 2-phase framework for qualitative process evaluations that seek to assess changes over time from a complex systems perspective. The first phase involves producing a description of the system and identifying hypotheses about how the system may change in response to the intervention. The second phase involves following the pathway of emergent findings in an adaptive evaluation approach.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Calls to a telephone health helpline (THHL) have been previously evaluated for the ability to monitor specific syndromes, such as fever and influenza-like-illness or gastrointestinal illness. This method of surveillance has been shown to be highly correlated with traditional surveillance methods, and to have potential for early detection of community-based illness. Self-sampling, or having a person take his/her own nasal swab, has also proven successful as a useful method for obtaining a specimen, which may be used for respiratory virus detection., METHODS: This study describes a self-swabbing surveillance system mediated by a nurse-led THHL in Ontario whereby syndromic surveillance concepts are used to recruit and monitor participants with influenza-like illness. Once recruited, participants collect a nasal specimen obtained by self-swabbing and submit for testing and laboratory confirmation. Enumeration of weekly case counts was used to evaluate the timeliness of the self-swabbing surveillance system through comparison to other respiratory virus and influenza surveillance systems in Ontario. The operational efficiency of the system was also evaluated., RESULTS: The mean and median number of days between the day that a participant called the THHL, to the day a package was received at the laboratory for testing were approximately 10.4 and 8.6 days, respectively. The time between self-swab collection and package reception was 4.9 days on average, with a median of 4 days. The self-swabbing surveillance system adequately captured the 2014 influenza B season in a timely manner when compared to other Ontario-based sources of influenza surveillance data from the same year; however, the emergence of influenza B was not detected any earlier than with these other surveillance systems. Influenza A surveillance was also evaluated. Using the THHL self-swabbing system, a peak in the number of cases for influenza A was observed approximately one week after or during the same week as that reported by the other surveillance systems., CONCLUSION: This one-year pilot study suggests that the THHL self-swabbing surveillance system has significant potential as an adjunct tool for the surveillance of influenza viruses in Ontario. Recommendations for improving system efficacy are discussed.},

  abstract = {Objective To develop an evidence-based guideline for Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies (PRESS) for systematic reviews (SRs), health technology assessments, and other evidence syntheses. Study Design and Setting An SR, Web-based survey of experts, and consensus development forum were undertaken to identify checklists that evaluated or validated electronic literature search strategies and to determine which of their elements related to search quality or errors. Results Systematic review: No new search elements were identified for addition to the existing (2008--2010) PRESS 2015 Evidence-Based Checklist, and there was no evidence refuting any of its elements. Results suggested that structured PRESS could identify search errors and improve the selection of search terms. Web-based survey of experts: Most respondents felt that peer review should be undertaken after the MEDLINE search had been prepared but before it had been translated to other databases. Consensus development forum: Of the seven original PRESS elements, six were retained: translation of the research question; Boolean and proximity operators; subject headings; text word search; spelling, syntax and line numbers; and limits and filters. The seventh (skilled translation of the search strategy to additional databases) was removed, as there was consensus that this should be left to the discretion of searchers. An updated PRESS 2015 Guideline Statement was developed, which includes the following four documents: PRESS 2015 Evidence-Based Checklist, PRESS 2015 Recommendations for Librarian Practice, PRESS 2015 Implementation Strategies, and PRESS 2015 Guideline Assessment Form. Conclusion The PRESS 2015 Guideline Statement should help to guide and improve the peer review of electronic literature search strategies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In Taiwan, around 1,500 cases of dengue fever are reported annually and incidence has been increasing over time. A national web-based Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NDSS) has been in operation since 1997 to monitor incidence and trends and support case and outbreak management. We present the findings of an evaluation of the NDSS to ascertain the extent to which dengue fever surveillance objectives are being achieved., METHODOLOGY: We extracted the NDSS data on all laboratory-confirmed dengue fever cases reported during 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2012 to assess and describe key system attributes based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveillance evaluation guidelines. The system's structure and processes were delineated and operational staff interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire. Crude and age-adjusted incidence rates were calculated and key demographic variables were summarised to describe reporting activity. Data completeness and validity were described across several variables., PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Of 5,072 laboratory-confirmed dengue fever cases reported during 2010-2012, 4,740 (93\%) were reported during July to December. The system was judged to be simple due to its minimal reporting steps. Data collected on key variables were correctly formatted and usable in {$>$} 90\% of cases, demonstrating good data completeness and validity. The information collected was considered relevant by users with high acceptability. Adherence to guidelines for 24-hour reporting was 99\%. Of 720 cases (14\%) recorded as travel-related, 111 (15\%) had an onset {$>$}14 days after return, highlighting the potential for misclassification. Information on hospitalization was missing for 22\% of cases. The calculated PVP was 43\%., CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The NDSS for dengue fever surveillance is a robust, well maintained and acceptable system that supports the collection of complete and valid data needed to achieve the surveillance objectives. The simplicity of the system engenders compliance leading to timely and accurate reporting. Completeness of hospitalization information could be further improved to allow assessment of severity of illness. To minimize misclassification, an algorithm to accurately classify travel cases should be established.}

But, there exists the need to better evaluate the performance and measure the costs., METHODS: We pilot tested an evaluation strategy in Hillsborough County, Florida using a conceptual framework of TB surveillance and action with eight core and four support activities. To evaluate performance, we developed indicators and validated their accuracy, usefulness, and measurability. To measure the costs, we obtained financial information., RESULTS: In 2001, Hillsborough County reported 78 (7\%) of the 1145 Florida TB cases. Nineteen (24\%) were previously arrested. While 13 (68\%) of the 19 were incarcerated during the 2 years prior to being reported, only 1 (5\%) of 19 was reported from the jail. From 111 TB suspects, 219 (25\%) of 894 sputum specimens were inadequately collected. Of the \$1.08 million annual budget, 22\% went for surveillance, 29\% for support, and 49\% for action., CONCLUSIONS: This conceptual framework allowed measurement of TB surveillance and action performance and cost. The evaluation performed using it revealed missed opportunities for detection of TB cases and wasted resources. This conceptual framework could serve as a model for evaluation of TB surveillance and action.}

  abstract = {Background: In February 2009, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of El Salvador launched SUMEVE, a unitary web-based system for monitoring and evaluation of HIV/AIDS. SUMEVE collects data on every person seeking testing or treatment for HIV/AIDS. In May 2009 we performed an early, qualitative analysis to verify whether the system was operating as designed. Method(s): We selected a convenience sample of 5/30 collection centres and 6/30 laboratories at regional and central level and performed a qualitative analysis assessing the system's resources and functioning, following CDC (Atlanta)'s "Updated Guidelines for Evaluating Public Health Surveillance Systems". Standardized interviews with SUMEVE-professionals were conducted to explore the system's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT-format). Result(s): Patient data are entered on paper forms when HIV rapid testing is requested at primary health-care facilities and forwarded with the HIV test results to the collection-centres for entry into the online database. 97\% of primary health care facilities and 100\% of HIV laboratories are reporting to SUMEVE, producing exhaustive data and showing wide system acceptability. Timeliness varies 1- 7 days between generating and digitizing notification forms for instant analysis. SWOT analysis shows as strengths a comprehensive legal framework for SUMEVE which is part of the National HIV/AIDS plan. Registration by name avoids double notification. Results are regularly published on MoH website. Data confidentiality is guaranteed by password-restricted access. The system has a flexible modular design allowing to amend and remove indicators. Identified weaknesses were: lacking reliable internet connection at two of the centres and that notification forms there could not be stored confidentially. As opportunities, we identified advocating renewed political commitment of the current government to guarantee the stability of SUMEVE and take actions in benefit of vulnerable groups identified by SUMEVE. No current threats to the system performance could be identified. Conclusion(s): SUMEVE is operating as planned on all levels, collecting exhaustive data of at least 97\% of primary health care facilities. Identified weaknesses are being improved. SUMEVE is the only surveillance system to direct public health interventions for HIV/AIDS. We recommend performing a re-evaluation after one year to assess the value of the SUMEVE for planning and executing intervention measures.}

  abstract = {Purpose: The objective of this study is to evaluate the timeliness of outbreak detection and response of most important infectious diseases occurring in five countries of South Eastern European Region, namely Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Macedonia and Kosovo*. This multicounty study was performed to demonstrate how public health institutions can conduct surveillance and response evaluation in relation to timeliness and to identify areas of improvement. Methods \& Materials: Diseases prioritization exercise was carried out and three of most important diseases for each country have been shortlisted. A spreadsheet tool was developed to collect in a structured format the surveillance timeliness data for the last five years. The completeness was calculated and compared for all diseases and all countries. The analysis of time lags between detection, confirmation, responding and reporting was estimated through descriptive methods based on measures of central tendency and complemented with graphical representations. Outbreak locations have been identified for all diseases and spatial distribution have been explored. Result(s): Eleven diseases where identified as most burdensome: Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever; Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome; West Nile Fever; Anthrax; Tularemia; Measles; Hepatitis A; Listeria; Influenza; Brucellosis; and foodborne infections. In general data to estimate time lags were complete, however missing information rate was estimated quite high for date of disease detection with 51.4\%, date of disease treatment with 57.8\% and date of patient hospitalization with 66.6\%. In general time from disease start to disease detection has a median of 1.0 days, time to laboratory diagnosis has a median of 8.0 days, time to disease treatment has a median of 4.0 days, and time to patient hospitalization has a median of 3.0 days. Disease reporting to national public health authorities is estimated with a median time of 4.0 days. Conclusion(s): All countries have surveillance systems based mainly on paper-based disease reporting and this poses a major concern related to timeliness measures. Electronic communication and training of clinicians, epidemiologists, and strengthening the collaboration between countries are necessary steps to be followed in order to mitigate the untimely reporting, enable early disease notification and subsequently improve the response time to cross-border disease outbreaks.Copyright {\copyright} 2018},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In recent years a wide variety of epidemiological surveillance systems have been developed to provide early identification of outbreaks of infectious disease. Each system has had its own strengths and weaknesses. In 2002 a Working Group of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) produced a framework for evaluation, which proved suitable for many public health surveillance systems. However this did not easily adapt to the military setting, where by necessity a variety of different parameters are assessed, different constraints placed on the systems, and different objectives required. This paper describes a proposed framework for evaluation of military syndromic surveillance systems designed to detect outbreaks of disease on operational deployments., METHODS: The new framework described in this paper was developed from the cumulative experience of British and French military syndromic surveillance systems. The methods included a general assessment framework (CDC), followed by more specific methods of conducting evaluation. These included Knowledge/Attitude/Practice surveys (KAP surveys), technical audits, ergonomic studies, simulations and multi-national exercises. A variety of military constraints required integration into the evaluation. Examples of these include the variability of geographical conditions in the field, deployment to areas without prior knowledge of naturally-occurring disease patterns, the differences in field sanitation between locations and over the length of deployment, the mobility of military forces, turnover of personnel, continuity of surveillance across different locations, integration with surveillance systems from other nations working alongside each other, compatibility with non-medical information systems, and security., RESULTS: A framework for evaluation has been developed that can be used for military surveillance systems in a staged manner consisting of initial, intermediate and final evaluations. For each stage of the process parameters for assessment have been defined and methods identified., CONCLUSION: The combined experiences of French and British syndromic surveillance systems developed for use in deployed military forces has allowed the development of a specific evaluation framework. The tool is suitable for use by all nations who wish to evaluate syndromic surveillance in their own military forces. It could also be useful for civilian mobile systems or for national security surveillance systems.},

A 2007 study found that only 35\% of hepatitis B cases that had been reported as acute infections met a rigorous case definition of acute hepatitis B, implying overreporting of new-onset infections. To increase the accuracy of reported acute hepatitis B infections, in 2013, we initiated enhanced hepatitis B surveillance in 200 sentinel counties. We compared incidences and proportions of different stages of hepatitis B infection before and after implementation of enhanced surveillance. We checked the accuracy of reported data and re-diagnosed hepatitis B cases reported as acute infection according to the enhanced diagnostic criteria and calculated positive predictive value(PPV) of acute hepatitis B reports. Compared to previous surveillance, with enhanced surveillance, the incidence of reported acute hepatitis B infection decreased by 53.7\% and the proportion of unclassified hepatitis B infection was reduced by 79.4\%. From 2013 to 2016, the PPV of acute hepatitis B increased (55.8\% to 71.0\%); PPV rates in western and rural areas were lower than in other areas. We recommend enhancing hepatitis B surveillance nationwide using these new standards, and raising western and rural areas clinicians' diagnostic and reporting capacity, and ensuring sufficient resources for IgM anti-HBc testing.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reducing maternal mortality still remains a major challenge in low-income countries. This study aims to explore how digital communication tools can be used to evaluate the maternal deaths surveillance and response (MDSR) system at the health district level in Guinea., METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted, using an innovative digital approach called District.Team, from April to September 2017. This study targeted all 38 district medical officers in Guinea. In addition to district medical officers, the participation of health actors from regional and central levels were also expected in the online discussion forum. Data collected through the questionnaire were mixed and those from the online discussion forum were entirely qualitative., RESULTS: In total, 23 (61\%) district medical officers (DMOs) participated in the study. Out of health districts (87\%) which had updated guidelines and standards for the MDSR, 4 (20\%) did not apply the content. In two health districts (8.7\%), not all health facilities had maternal deaths notification forms. Three districts (13\%) did not have maternal death review committees. In 2016, only half (50.2\%) of reported maternal deaths were reviewed. The main recommendation formulated was related to quality of care. Other needs were also highlighted including continuous training of health care providers on emergency obstetric and neonatal care. Less than half (45\%) of the review committee's recommendations were implemented. Six health districts (26.1\%) did not have a response plan to reported maternal deaths and no district annual report on the MDSR was published in 2016. The weaknesses identified were, among others, insufficiency of human resources and lack of financial resources. Fifty-eight messages related to MDSR weaknesses and improvement solutions were posted in the online discussion forum by 28 participants (23 DMOs and 5 health actors from regional and central levels)., CONCLUSION: Digital tools can be used to assess the functioning of a system like maternal deaths surveillance and response. Moreover, the findings of the evaluation conducted will help stakeholders (starting from the health districts themselves) to design strategies and interventions for an effective MDSR.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chlamydia and gonorrhea cases continue to rise in Illinois, increasing by 16.4\% and 70.9\% in 2019, respectively, compared with 2015. Providers are required to report both chlamydia and gonorrhea, as mandated by public health laws. Manual reporting remains a huge burden; 90\%-93\% of cases were reported to Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) via electronic laboratory reporting (ELR), and the remaining were reported through web-based data entry platforms, faxes, and phone calls. However, cases reported via ELRs only contain information available to a laboratory facility and do not contain additional data needed for public health. Such data are typically found in an electronic health record (EHR). Electronic case reports (eCRs) were developed and automated the generation of case reports from EHRs to be reported to public health agencies., OBJECTIVE: Prior studies consolidated trigger criteria for eCRs, and compared with manual reporting, found it to be more complete. The goal of this project is to pilot standards-based eCR for chlamydia and gonorrhea. We evaluated the throughput, completeness, and timeliness of eCR compared to ELR, as well as the implementation experience at a large health center-controlled network in Illinois., METHODS: For this study, we selected 8 clinics located on the north, west, and south sides of Chicago to implement the eCRs; these cases were reported to IDPH. The study period was 52 days. The centralized EHR used by these clinics leveraged 2 of the 3 case detection scenarios, which were previously defined as the trigger, to generate an eCR. These messages were successfully transmitted via Health Level 7 electronic initial case report standard. Upon receipt by IDPH, these eCRs were parsed and housed in a staging database., RESULTS: During the study period, 183 eCRs representing 135 unique patients were received by IDPH. eCR reported 95\% (n=113 cases) of all the chlamydia cases and 97\% (n=70 cases) of all the gonorrhea cases reported from the participating clinical sites. eCR found an additional 14 (19\%) cases of gonorrhea that were not reported via ELR. However, ELR reported an additional 6 cases of chlamydia and 2 cases of gonorrhea, which were not reported via eCR. ELR reported 100\% of chlamydia cases but only 81\% of gonorrhea cases. While key elements such as patient and provider names were complete in both eCR and ELR, eCR was found to report additional clinical data, including history of present illness, reason for visit, symptoms, diagnosis, and medications., CONCLUSIONS: eCR successfully identified and created automated reports for chlamydia and gonorrhea cases in the implementing clinics in Illinois. eCR demonstrated a more complete case report and represents a promising future of reducing provider burden for reporting cases while achieving greater semantic interoperability between health care systems and public health.

  abstract = {Background. Access to good quality information from injury surveillance is essential to develop and monitor injury prevention activities. To determine if information obtained from surveillance is of high quality, the limitations and strengths of a surveillance system are often examined. Guidelines have been developed to assist in evaluating certain types of surveillance systems. However, to date, no standard guidelines have been developed to specifically evaluate an injury surveillance system. The aim of this research is to develop a framework to guide the evaluation of injury surveillance systems. Methods. The development of an Evaluation Framework for Injury Surveillance Systems (EFISS) involved a four stage process. First, a literature review was conducted to identify an initial set of characteristics that were recognised as important and/or had been recommended to be assessed in an evaluation of a surveillance system. Second, this set of characteristics was assessed using SMART criteria. Third, those surviving were presented to an expert panel using a two round modified-Delphi study to gain an alternative perspective on characteristic definitions, practicality of assessment, and characteristic importance. Finally, a rating system was created for the EFISS characteristics. Results. The resulting EFISS consisted of 18 characteristics that assess three areas of an injury surveillance system five characteristics assess data quality, nine characteristics assess the system's operation, and four characteristics assess the practical capability of an injury surveillance system. A rating system assesses the performance of each characteristic. Conclusion. The development of the EFISS builds upon existing evaluation guidelines for surveillance systems and provides a framework tailored to evaluate an injury surveillance system. Ultimately, information obtained through an evaluation of an injury data collection using the EFISS would be useful for agencies to recommend how a collection could be improved to increase its usefulness for injury surveillance and in the long-term injury prevention. {\copyright} 2009 Mitchell et al.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) surveillance data are crucial to the effectiveness of National TB Control Programs. In South Africa, few surveillance system evaluations have been undertaken to provide a rigorous assessment of the platform from which the national and district health systems draws data to inform programs and policies., OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the attributes of Eden District's TB surveillance system, Western Cape Province, South Africa., METHODS: Data quality, sensitivity and positive predictive value were assessed using secondary data from 40,033 TB cases entered in Eden District's ETR.Net from 2007 to 2013, and 79 purposively selected TB Blue Cards (TBCs), a medical patient file and source document for data entered into ETR.Net. Simplicity, flexibility, acceptability, stability and usefulness of the ETR.Net were assessed qualitatively through interviews with TB nurses, information health officers, sub-district and district coordinators involved in the TB surveillance., RESULTS: TB surveillance system stakeholders report that Eden District's ETR.Net system was simple, acceptable, flexible and stable, and achieves its objective of informing TB control program, policies and activities. Data were less complete in the ETR.Net (66-100\%) than in the TBCs (76-100\%), and concordant for most variables except pre-treatment smear results, antiretroviral therapy (ART) and treatment outcome. The sensitivity of recorded variables in ETR.Net was 98\% for gender, 97\% for patient category, 93\% for ART, 92\% for treatment outcome and 90\% for pre-treatment smear grading., CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal that the system provides useful information to guide TB control program activities in Eden District. However, urgent attention is needed to address gaps in clinical recording on the TBC and data capturing into the ETR.Net system. We recommend continuous training and support of TB personnel involved with TB care, management and surveillance on TB data recording into the TBCs and ETR.Net as well as the implementation of a well-structured quality control and assurance system.},

We used four criteria for the comparison of the data collection tools: completeness, timeliness, conformity and cost., RESULTS: Regarding the different collection tools, data sent by the EWS were significantly more complete (97.6\% vs 81.6\% vs 44.8\%), prompt (74.4\% vs n/a vs 60.7\%) and of better quality (93.7\% vs 76.1\% vs 84.0\%) than data sent by the paper-based system and SMS, respectively. The average cost of sending a datum by a sentinel site per week was higher for the forms (5.0 USD) than for the EWS (0.9 USD) and SMS (0.1 USD). The number of outpatient visits and subsequently all surveillance data decreased across the years 2017-2019 together with the influenza positivity rate from 30.7\% to 28.3\%. Contrarily, the proportion of influenza-associated ILI to outpatient load was highest in the year 2019 (0.37 per 100 persons vs 0.28 and 0.26 in the other 2 years)., CONCLUSION: All sentinel sites and even other disease surveillance systems are expected to use this tool in the near term future due to its satisfactory performance and cost.

For each infection, and for each reporting jurisdiction, we generated smoothed standardized morbidity ratios (SMR) and surveillance to hospitalization ratios (SHR) by comparing observed surveillance counts with expected values or the number of hospitalized cases, respectively. We examined the spatial distribution of SHR and related this to the mean for the entire state. Through this approach municipalities that deviated from the typical experience were identified and suspected of under-reporting. Regression analysis revealed that SHR was a significant predictor of SMR, after adjusting for population age-structure. This confirms that the spatial "signal" depicted by surveillance is in part influenced by inconsistent testing and reporting practices since municipalities that reported fewer cases relative to the number of hospitalizations had a lower relative risk (as estimated by SMR). Periodic assessment of SHR has potential in assessing the performance of surveillance systems.}

The measures commonly used to quantify detection capabilities are sensitivity, positive predictive value and timeliness. However, the practical application of these measures to multi-purpose syndromic surveillance services is complex. Specifically, it is very difficult to link definitive lists of what the service is intended to detect and what was detected. First, we discuss issues arising from a multi-purpose system, which is designed to detect a wide range of health threats, and where individual indicators, e.g. 'fever', are also multi-purpose. Secondly, we discuss different methods of defining what can be detected, including historical events and simulations. Finally, we consider the additional complexity of evaluating a service which incorporates human decision-making alongside an automated detection algorithm. Understanding the complexities involved in evaluating multi-purpose systems helps design appropriate methods to describe their detection capabilities. Copyright This is an Open Access article.

Methods This was a retrospective descriptive study of epidemiological surveillance for measles and German measles in Colombia from 1995 to 2009 by reviewing available notification information from the measles elimination surveillance system (MESS), the Colombian Public Health Surveillance System (SIVIGILA) and the Colombian Statistics Department (DANE) for population projections. Surveillance quality was evaluated by using the indicators proposed for integrated measles and German measles surveillance. Results 28,732 suspicious cases were notified during the study period (66.15 \% concerned measles and 33.8 \% German measles). The greatest number of notified cases occurred in 2002 (22.4 \%); this was detected in the 6-11 month and 2-4 yearold groups. Confirmed measles cases amounted to 495 (1995-2002) and German measles to 946 (for the whole period). The cumulative average for indicators was as follows: timely research had a pattern below 80.5 \%, weekly notification was above 80 \%, suitable sampling was 93.7 \% on average and sample reception was 65.2 \% for 1995-2006 and 83.3 \% for 2007-2009. Conclusions According to the information compiled regarding epidemiological surveillance, Colombia complied with 4 of the 7 proposed indicators for quality evaluation; these showed active surveillance having suitable indicator performance regarding laboratory and notification rate.

  abstract = {Disease reporting is an essential frontline component of surveillance systems, particularly for detecting incursions of new and emerging diseases. It has the advantages of being comprehensive and continuous, with the potential to reduce the time of disease detection and the extent of consequent spread. A number of exotic diseases, including sheep and goat pox, lumpy skin disease, peste des petits ruminants and foot and mouth disease have historically entered into south-eastern Europe through the Thrace region, which extends across neighbouring areas of Greece, Bulgaria and Turkey. In this high-risk area, multiple factors can reduce the sensitivity of disease reporting across the diverse production systems and animal health services need robust and effective disease reporting systems. While describing a training exercise designed to provide animal health services of the three countries with the knowledge and skills for conducting comprehensive in-country assessments, we provide an initial evaluation of the sensitivity of foot and mouth disease reporting and identify gaps and constraints in the Thrace region. An expert elicitation approach was used to consult official veterinarians from central and local animal health authorities of the three countries, and scenario trees modelling was applied to analyse the collected data. The reported sensitivity of disease reporting often varied between the central and local veterinary authorities within the three countries. Awareness of clinical disease, of reporting procedures and of biosecurity measures affected the early stages of disease reporting, particularly in the production systems identified at lower reporting sensitivity such as small ruminant's herds, mixed bovine herds and backyard herds. Despite its limitations this training exercise provided an effective framework (a) to develop capacities of the veterinary services in the region and (b) to supply initial evidence for guiding further interventions targeting those sectors and stakeholders at lower reporting sensitivity to reduce risks of disease introduction.},

The OH-EpiCap tool was created to evaluate the degree of compliance of hazard surveillance activities with essential OH concepts across there dimensions: organization, operational activities, and impact of the OH surveillance system. To present feedback on the application of the OH-EpiCap from a user's perspective, the tool was used to evaluate nine national AMR surveillance systems, each with different monitoring contexts and objectives. The OH-EpiCap tool was assessed using the updated CoEvalAMR methodology. This methodology evaluates the content themes and functional aspects of the tool in a standardized way, while it also captures the user's subjective experiences in using the tool via a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) approach. The results of the evaluation of the OH-EpiCap are presented and discussed. The OH-EpiCap is an easy-to-use tool, which can facilitate a fast macro-overview of the application of the OH concept to a surveillance activity, when used by specialists in the matter, serving as a basis for the discussion of possible adaptations of AMR surveillance activities, or targeting areas that may be further investigated using other pre-established tools.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

A consistent definition was applied to determine definite and probable cases of ARF using clinical records. (www.heartfoundation.org.nz) RESULTS: Of 559 confirmed (definite and probable) RF cases {$<$}15 years (median age 10 years), seven were recurrences. Of 552 first episodes, the ARRFR identified 548 (99\%), hospitalisations identified 501 (91\%) including four not on the register, and public health notifications identified 384 (70\%). Of hospitalisation cases, 33\% (245/746), and of notifications 20\% (94/478) did not meet the case definition and were therefore excluded. Between 1998-2010, eight cases, initially entered as ARF on the ARRFR, were later removed once further clinical detail was available., CONCLUSION: The ARRFR produced the most accurate information surrounding new cases of ARF (for children {$<$}15 years) for the years 1998-2010 in Auckland. This was significantly more accurate than medical officer of health notification and hospitalisation data.},

New early warning systems leveraging timely electronic data are emerging, but the public health value of such systems is still largely unknown., OBJECTIVE: To assess the timeliness and accuracy of pharmacy sales data for both respiratory and gastrointestinal infections and to determine its utility in supporting the surveillance of gastrointestinal illness., METHODS: To assess timeliness, a prospective and retrospective analysis of data feeds was used to compare the chronological characteristics of each data stream. To assess accuracy, Ontario antiviral prescriptions were compared to confirmed cases of influenza and cases of influenza-like-illness (ILI) from August 2009 to January 2015 and Nova Scotia sales of respiratory over-the-counter products (OTC) were compared to laboratory reports of respiratory pathogen detections from January 2014 to March 2015. Enteric outbreak data (2011-2014) from Nova Scotia were compared to sales of gastrointestinal products for the same time period. To assess utility, pharmacy sales of gastrointestinal products were monitored across Canada to detect unusual increases and reports were disseminated to the provinces and territories once a week between December 2014 and March 2015 and then a follow-up evaluation survey of stakeholders was conducted., RESULTS: Ontario prescriptions of antivirals between 2009 and 2015 correlated closely with the onset dates and magnitude of confirmed influenza cases. Nova Scotia sales of respiratory OTC products correlated with increases in non-influenza respiratory pathogens in the community. There were no definitive correlations identified between the occurrence of enteric outbreaks and the sales of gastrointestinal OTCs in Nova Scotia. Evaluation of national monitoring showed no significant increases in sales of gastrointestinal products that could be linked to outbreaks that included more than one province or territory., CONCLUSION: Monitoring of pharmacy-based drug prescriptions and OTC sales can provide a timely and accurate complement to traditional respiratory public health surveillance activities but initial evaluation did not show that tracking gastrointestinal-related OTCs were of value in identifying an enteric disease outbreak in more than one province or territory during the study period.}

Surveillance evaluation should be an integral part of the surveillance life cycle, as it provides a means to identify and correct problems and to sustain and enhance the existing strengths of a surveillance system. The surveillance evaluation Framework (SurF) presented here was developed to provide a generic framework within which the MPI biosecurity surveillance portfolio, and all of its components, can be consistently assessed. SurF is an innovative, cross-sectoral effort that aims to provide a common umbrella for surveillance evaluation in the animal, plant, environment and aquatic sectors. It supports the conduct of the following four distinct components of an evaluation project: (i) motivation for the evaluation, (ii) scope of the evaluation, (iii) evaluation design and implementation and (iv) reporting and communication of evaluation outputs. Case studies, prepared by MPI subject matter experts, are included in the framework to guide users in their assessment. Three case studies were used in the development of SurF in order to assure practical utility and to confirm usability of SurF across all included sectors. It is anticipated that the structured approach and information provided by SurF will not only be of benefit to MPI but also to other New Zealand stakeholders. Although SurF was developed for internal use by MPI, it could be applied to any surveillance system in New Zealand or elsewhere. Copyright {\copyright} 2018 2018 The Authors.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To introduce the Canadian Network for Public Health Intelligence's new Knowledge Integration using Web-based Intelligence (KIWI) technology, and to pefrom preliminary evaluation of the KIWI technology using a case study. The purpose of this new technology is to support surveillance activities by monitoring unstructured data sources for the early detection and awareness of potential public health threats., METHODS: A prototype of the KIWI technology, adapted for zoonotic and emerging diseases, was piloted by end-users with expertise in the field of public health and zoonotic/emerging disease surveillance. The technology was assessed using variables such as geographic coverage, user participation, and others; categorized by high-level attributes from evaluation guidelines for internet based surveillance systems. Special attention was given to the evaluation of the system's automated sense-making algorithm, which used variables such as sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values. Event-based surveillance evaluation was not applied to its full capacity as such an evaluation is beyond the scope of this paper., RESULTS: KIWI was piloted with user participation = 85.0\% and geographic coverage within monitored sources = 83.9\% of countries. The pilots, which focused on zoonotic and emerging diseases, lasted a combined total of 65 days and resulted in the collection of 3243 individual information pieces (IIP) and 2 community reported events (CRE) for processing. Ten sources were monitored during the second phase of the pilot, which resulted in 545 anticipatory intelligence signals (AIS). KIWI's automated sense-making algorithm (SMA) had sensitivity = 63.9\% (95\% CI: 60.2-67.5\%), specificity = 88.6\% (95\% CI: 87.3-89.8\%), positive predictive value = 59.8\% (95\% CI: 56.1-63.4\%), and negative predictive value = 90.3\% (95\% CI: 89.0-91.4\%)., DISCUSSION: Literature suggests the need for internet based monitoring and surveillance systems that are customizable, integrated into collaborative networks of public health professionals, and incorporated into national surveillance activities. Results show that the KIWI technology is well posied to address some of the suggested challenges. A limitation of this study is that sample size for pilot participation was small for capturing overall readiness of integrating KIWI into regular surveillance activities., CONCLUSIONS: KIWI is a customizable technology developed within an already thriving collaborative platform used by public health professionals, and performs well as a tool for discipline-specific event monitoring and early warning signal detection.},

Since 2009, Bogota has a sentinel surveillance subsystem for oral health (SISVESO) in 134 units of 750. The objective of the study was to evaluate the performance and qualitative attributes, quality, timeliness and representativeness of the surveillance subsystem in the city of Bogot{\'a}. Materials and Methods: Evaluation of SISVESO using the methodology of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. To evaluate the qualitative attributes, virtual surveys were carried out on 72 dentists from the sentinel units; a focus group with oral health surveillance teams from the localities where 21 staff members participated, and three interviews with officials of the District of Health. To evaluate the utility, quality, timeliness and representativeness documents and databases were reviewed. Qualitative analysis by triangulation using NVIVO software and calculation of frequency measurements for quantitative attributes. Results: Simplicity: it was considered simple the filling of the registries. Flexibility: the subsystem has had different changes in case definition and inclusion of variables. Acceptability: Local officials report a lack of human and financial resources to carry out monitoring activities. Stability: the management of the data is carried out continuously. Utility: the subsystem provides valuable information for the formulation of public policies. Quality: 122,321 records were identified, 99\% did not present repeated cases. Opportunity: officers get information annually. Representativeness: indicators were similar to those reported in the national oral health surveys and health data. Conclusion: The subsystem is useful, representative, simple and flexible, with excellent data quality. It meets the proposed monitoring objectives. It is necessary to take actions to improve the timeliness, acceptability and dissemination of information to support decision making. It is necessary to establish mechanisms to ensure the continuous financing of subsystem operation.},

The Medicines Control Authority of Zimbabwe monitors reactions to medicines through the Adverse Drugs Reactions Surveillance System. The system relies on health professionals to report adverse drug reactions to maximize patient safety. We report results of an evaluation of the Adverse Drugs Reactions Surveillance System in Kadoma District. Methods: a descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted using the updated CDC guidelines in six health facilities in Kadoma City. Data were collected using a pretested interviewer administered questionnaire, checklists and records review. Data was analyzed using Epi InfoTM to calculate frequencies and means. Qualitative data were analyzed manually. Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants. Results: the surveillance system did not meet up to its objectives as it failed to detect the adverse drug reactions and there was no monitoring of increases in known events. Fewer than half (43\%) of the participants were aware of at least 2 objectives of the surveillance system but 83\% of health workers willing to participate. However the system was not acceptable, 79\% did not perceive the system to be necessary with the majority saying "why should we fill in the forms when the reactions were already known or minor". Though the system was supposed to identify potential patient risk factors for particular types of events health workers were reluctant to participate as evidenced by only one form filled out of 20 reactions experienced in the district. The system was simple as the notification form has 16 fields which require easily obtainable information from the patient records. Conclusion: the surveillance system was not useful and was not acceptable to health workers but was simple and stable. Health workers lacked knowledge. Sharing of results with the Medicines Control Authority of Zimbabwe through the Matrons facilitated training of health workers in Kadoma City. Health workers were encouraged to notify any drug reaction and to completely fill in the notification forms. Patients were also encouraged to report any drug reaction to health care workers.},

In South Africa lungs of deceased miners are examined for compensation, and findings have been stored on the PATHAUT database since 1975. We reviewed the database using the Centres for Disease Control guidelines for public health surveillance systems. Method(s): Usefulness was evaluated according to five attributes: disease detection, measurements of disease magnitude and trends, if it permits assessment of control programs and stimulates research. Published papers and reports were reviewed. Result(s): There were 11 901 records (1975-2016) representing 25 mining commodities mostly (72\%) gold. Clinical-pathological studies showed much disease is missed in life: 52\%, 50\% and 30\% for tuberculosis (TB), asbestosis and silicosis respectively. Among black gold miners silicosis prevalence increased from 4\% (1975) to 42\% (2016). TB increased from 3\%, peaked at 43\% (2008) and fell to 25\% (2016). Determinants for silicosis trend were increasing age, employment duration and year of autopsy. Additional determinants for TB were silicosis and HIV. The data reflect ineffective silica dust control programs. The decline in TB was attributable to HIV treatment, instituted in 2004. There have been over 150 research outputs. Despite some positive impact on the workplace ongoing social, economic and institutional factors have impeded their translation into effective interventions. Conclusion(s): PATHAUT, the only surveillance system for OLD in South Africa, fulfils CDC criteria for usefulness. Utilisation of administrative data should be pursued where surveillance systems are lacking.},

  abstract = {Background: The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; named 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV) disease in China at the end of 2019 has led to pandemic. A robust surveillance system is required for true estimation of burden of the disease. This study was conducted to identify the strengths and weaknesses of laboratory-based COVID-19 surveillance system in Pakistan and to propose some doable actions for improvement. Method: An evaluative study was conducted from February to March 2020 at National Institute of Health (NIH) Islamabad, Pakistan. CDC's ``Updated Guidelines for Evaluation Public Health Surveillance System-2001'' were used to evaluate the COVID-19 disease surveillance system. Information was gathered and analyzed on different system attributes using qualitative and quantitative methods. Results: System found simple, stable and readily acceptable at all public and private sectors with flexibility to incorporate other respiratory pathogens detection. Reporting was timely, typically within 24-48 hours of sample reception, using electronic as well as paper-based management system. All stakeholders contributed in this health emergency. With evolving cases definition and unknown prevalence till first week of April, sensitivity and predictive value positive was found 1.25\% and 4.50\% respectively. Representativeness was good since it is a reference lab with few sentinel sites for COVID-19 specific testing. Conclusion: Based on the findings of this study, system meets the initial objectives of the surveillance but rapid expansion of sentinel sites along with continuous provision of logistics, supplies and trained human resources is needed to meet the increasing need of detection in wake of rapidly spreading pandemic. {\copyright} 2020 The Author(s).},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In Zimbabwe the integrated disease surveillance and response guidelines include maternal mortality as a notifiable event reported through the Maternal Mortality Surveillance System (MMSS). A preliminary review of the MMSS data for Mutare district for the period January to June 2014 revealed that there were some discrepancies in cases notified and those captured on the T5 monthly return form. There were also delays in reporting of some maternal deaths. Poor reporting indicated shortcomings in the MMSS in Mutare district and we therefore sought to assess the performance of the maternal mortality surveillance system in Mutare district., METHODS: A descriptive cross sectional study was conducted using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated guidelines for evaluating public health surveillance systems. A total of 64 health workers were enrolled into the study from 19 selected health facilities in Mutare district and 32 maternal death notification forms submitted in 2014 to the provincial office were reviewed to assess the quality of information on the forms. Interviewer administered questionnaires were used to collect information from enrolled health workers, the system's attributes namely usefulness, acceptability, simplicity, stability, data quality, timeliness and completeness were assessed and a checklist was used to assess availability of resources for the implementation of the maternal mortality surveillance. We also determined the cost of reporting each maternal death in Mutare district., RESULTS: Half of the study participants gave the correct definition of a maternal death. All health workers participated and were willing to continue participating in the maternal mortality surveillance. Majority of health workers, 79.7\% used data generated from the surveillance system and 59.5\% found it easy to implement the system. A total of 32 death notification forms were reviewed and of these, 31 forms were forwarded to the national office and all did not reach the national office on time. Average completeness of notification forms was 76.0\% and 53.1\% of the forms had all the necessary accompanying documents. Reporting each maternal death was estimated to cost \$28.65 in Mutare district., CONCLUSION: The strongest components of the maternal mortality surveillance system in Mutare district were usefulness and acceptability. Timeliness and completeness were the weaker components of the system. The system was found to be simple; however, resources were not adequately available in all health facilities.},

  abstract = {Objectives: The effects of cement dust exposure on acute respiratory health were assessed among 51 high exposed and 33 low exposed male cement workers. The ability of the questionnaire to diagnose acute decrease in ventilatory function was also assessed. Methods: Acute respiratory symptoms were recorded by interview using a structured optimal symptom score questionnaire. Peak expiratory flow (PEF) was measured preshift and postshift for each worker with a Mini-Wright PEF meter. Personal respirable dust (n=30) and total dust (n=15) were measured with 37-mm Cyclone and 37-mm closed-faced Millipore cassette. Twenty-nine workers had concurrent respirable dust, PEF and questionnaire on the same day. Results: The geometric means of personal respirable dust and total dust among high exposed were 4.0 and 13.2 mg/m3, respectively, and 0.7 and 1.0 mg/m3 among low exposed. High exposed workers had more acute cough, shortness of breath and stuffy nose than the low exposed. Mean percentage cross-shift decrease in PEF was significantly more pronounced among high exposed workers than low exposed (95\% CI 1.1, 6.1\%). For workers with concurrent respirable dust, PEF and questionnaire assessment, an exposure-response relationship was found between log-transformed respirable dust and percentage cross-shift decrease in PEF (4.5\% per unit of log-respirable dust in mg/m3; 95\% CI 3.3, 5.6\%). Respirable dust exposure {$\geq$}2.0 mg/m3 versus {$<$}2.0 mg/m3 was associated with increased prevalence ratio for cough (7.9) and shortness of breath (4.2). Shortness of breath was associated with the highest sensitivity (0.87) and specificity (0.83) for diagnosing a percentage cross-shift decrease in PEF of {$\geq$}10\%. Conclusion: The observed acute respiratory health effects among the workers are most likely due to exposure to high concentrations of irritant cement dust. The results also highlight the usefulness of the questionnaire for health surveillance of the acute respiratory health effect.},

  abstract = {Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems (HDSS) have been set up in various sites in Africa and Asia. In the absence of effective vital registration and information on mortality, these health and demographic surveillance systems have well developed structures and standard operating procedures established to periodically monitor vital events like births, deaths and migrations in well defined areas to produce population health information. In Tanzania Ifakara DSS remain as an instrumental infrastructure of producing key demographic indicators that are useful for planning and resource allocation to the community. The aim of my study is to determine the effectiveness of Ifakara HDSS in quantifying the impact of malaria control strategies and interventions. A cross sectional study design will be used to assess HDSS documentation mechanism on the impact of different malaria control strategies and interventions performed in the area, and to determine if the project effectively quantifies the impact of those interventions and strategies. Systematic sampling will be used to obtain number and types of documents that will be reviewed to fulfill the aim of our study. Collection and analysis of data will be both qualitative and quantities approach. Findings will be explained based on: 1) extent the knowledge and skills of the project staff in content of the HDSS malaria forms and data quality checking has increased from the pre to the post intervention periods of the project, 2) extent to which the malaria information management has improved, 3) ways in which the project was able to promote quality malaria data generation, 4) extents to which costs were able to reach project goal of documenting impact of malaria control strategies and interventions, and 4) how the HDSS understood and cared about the importance of resources at work and if the managers supported them with training, supervision and needed resources. The conclusion will be based upon findings that will be obtained during the data collection.},

  abstract = {Objectives In Japan, nationwide data of the incidence of infectious diseases have been collected via the National Epidemiological Surveillance of Infectious Diseases (NESID) since 1981. In addition, since March 2014, Kawasaki City has operated its own real-time surveillance (RTS) system to collect data of the incidence of influenza from medical institutions across the city. This study aimed to describe the characteristics of the RTS system and compare the two surveillance systems to improve measures against infectious diseases in the future. Methods NESID and RTS data from March 2014 to October 2017 were obtained from the Kawasaki City Institute for Public Health. First, the operating methodologies of the two surveillance systems were compared. Second, RTS data were used to analyze the daily epidemic curve, and then the daily number of influenza cases was converted into weekly data for comparison with NESID data. Pearson's correlation coefficients and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Correlations were also analyzed after data for the last and first weeks of each year were excluded because few hospitals remain open around the New Year holiday, resulting in a disproportionately large number of patients visiting the few institutions that remain open. Results The NESID relies on data provided by a fixed number of medical institutions determined each fiscal year (mean: 56.0+/-4.2 institutions), while the number of institutions providing data for the RTS varies daily or monthly. In September 2017, 691 of the 1,032 eligible institutions (67.0\%) were registered for the RTS. Pearson's correlation coefficient for the two surveillance systems was 0.975 (95\%CI, 0.967-0.981); when data for the last and first week of each year were excluded, it was 0.989 (95\%CI 0.986-0.992). In each of the three seasons that were investigated, an increase in the incidence of type A influenza preceded an increase in the incidence of type B influenza. Conclusion The operating methodologies of the two surveillance systems differed; however, the results identified a strong correlation, confirming the reliability of the RTS. The RTS collects daily data by influenza type; therefore, it detects epidemic onsets at an earlier stage, facilitating more detailed epidemiological analysis, compared with that of the NESID. It is necessary to understand differences in the characteristics between two surveillance systems when we analyze influenza surveillance data.},

  abstract = {In Spain, the eradication of tuberculosis (TB) in cattle has had some setbacks and therefore we need to re-evaluate the current surveillance strategies. The Spanish cattle TB surveillance system consists of three components: a) routine skin testing, b) slaughterhouse surveillance, and c) pre-movement controls. Our objectives were to assess the effectiveness of the whole surveillance system and evaluate the relative contribution of each of those components, both at national and at the province level. The effectiveness was estimated based on both the sensitivity of detection per year and the time until detection. Moreover, we evaluated the impact of different factors on that effectiveness. We used a stochastic model that simulated the spread of Mycobacterium tuberculosis-complex (MTC) infection within cattle herds that was modified to incorporate the three components of TB surveillance. Input data, at the province level, on cattle movements off-farm or the frequency of the routine screening were provided by the Spanish Ministry for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Under the current conditions, 96.1\% of Spanish herds were detected within one year after their infection (i.e. mean sensitivity of TB surveillance), although that detection took on average 178 days. The surveillance system effectiveness was highly dependent on the routine skin testing, responsible for the detection of almost 90\% of the infected herds, while slaughterhouse surveillance and pre-movement controls contributed only to the identification of a small proportion of infected herds. We observed substantial differences in the effectiveness of the surveillance components among Spanish provinces, although in general, the sensitivities were high. The most influential factor on the efficiency of TB detection in Spain was, by far, the frequency of routine controls, followed by the sensitivity of the test used. In a context of reduced funding for cattle TB eradication, the frequency of testing should be adapted based on risk-based surveillance strategies, i.e. efforts should focus on herds more likely to be infected, but also in herds more likely to infect other herds. While slaughterhouse surveillance seems a cost-effective strategy, the use of pre-movement testing at least in areas of low incidence should be further evaluated.

A case of Legionnaires' disease was defined as a person treated for pneumonia in whom legionella had been detected. Patient details were collected from (1) mandatory notifications; (2) the National Reference Centre for Legionella; (3) a postal survey of all hospital laboratories. The three sources were cross-matched and 715 individual cases were identified. A log-linear model, which included an interaction term between mandatory notifications and both the National Reference Centre and Laboratory sources, provided an estimated total of 1124 cases (95 \% CI 973-1275) in 1998, a twofold increase compared with 1995. The sensitivity of the surveillance system improved from 10 \% in 1995 to 33 \% (95 \% CI 29-38 \%) in 1998. Capture-recapture methods are important tools in the evaluation of surveillance systems.},

The evaluation included interviews with Register staff, local community organizations, parents, clinicians, and researchers; process observation; and secondary data analyses., RESULTS: WARDA-BD is a statutory, statewide, population-based surveillance system established in 1980 that monitors approximately 30,000 births annually. Identification of eligible cases is for children up to age 6 years through active and passive ascertainment methods from multiple sources including birth, death, and hospitalization data; antenatal ultrasonography; hospital unit logs; medical records; fetal medicine departments; cytogenetic laboratories; specialty clinics; and pediatric surgery and pathology departments. Defect diagnoses are verified and coded using the 5-digit British Paediatric Association extension of the International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision system. Register staff monitor Register data for completeness and accuracy resulting in high quality data with a low percentage of missing items., CONCLUSION: Strengths of WARDA-BD include high data quality, timeliness, representativeness, stable funding, active community engagement, and high staff retention. Its data were used in numerous epidemiologic investigations resulting in {$>$}325 peer-reviewed publications. Potential weaknesses include the limited number of variables collected and low visibility. Although WARDA-BD uses labor intensive case ascertainment and quality assurance and control processes, the Register provides accurate and essential data for stakeholders.

  abstract = {MEASURE Evaluation has worked with the National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) since 2015 to strengthen malaria surveillance in Madagascar with support from the U.S. President's Malaria Initiative and partners. After a 2015 baseline survey of key malaria surveillance indicators in the national integrated disease surveillance and response (IDSR) system including completeness, timeliness of reporting and data accuracy we conducted a follow-up survey in 2018 and compared the results of the two surveys. T-test for means from independent samples were estimated and p-values calculated. Differences were considered significant if p{$<$}0.05. Completeness of routine malaria reporting by health facilities (Centres De Sante De Base: CSB) was 73.0\% in 2018 compared with 65.3\% in 2015 (p=0.214). Timeliness of CSB reporting was 68.4\% in 2018 compared with 45.5\% in 2015 (p=0.0005). Completeness of community-based reporting was 94.3\% in 2018 compared to 8.6\% in 2015 (p{$<$}0.00001) while timeliness was 55.0\% in 2018 compared to 5.2\% in 2015 (p{$<$}0.00001). Regarding data accuracy, the comparison of data from weekly reporting forms to weekly malaria data in registries showed 87.0 \% accuracy in a randomized sample of CSB in 2018 compared to 73.3\% in 2015 (p{$<$}0.00001). MEASURE Evaluation's support in strengthening malaria SME in Madagascar has likely contributed to these significant improvements in malaria and overall IDSR data reporting both at facility and community levels. These trends need to be maintained and improved, especially because Madagascar is considering malaria elimination in the coming years.},

  abstract = {Background: Control of preventive chemotherapy-targeted neglected tropical diseases (PC-NTDs) relies on strengthened health systems. Efficient health information systems provide an impetus to achieving the sustainable development goal aimed at ending PC-NTD epidemics. However, there is limited assessment of surveillance system functions linked to PC-NTDs and hinged on optimum performance of surveillance system attributes. The study aimed to evaluate surveillance system attributes based on healthcare workers' perceptions in relation to PC-NTDs endemic in Kenya. Methods: A cross-sectional health facility survey was used to purposively sample respondents involved in disease surveillance activities. Consenting respondents completed a self-administered questionnaire that assessed their perceptions on surveillance system attributes on a five-point likert scale. Frequency distributions for each point in the likert scale were analysed to determine health workers' overall perceptions. Data was analysed using descriptive statistics and estimated median values with corresponding interquartile ranges used to summarise reporting rates. Factor analysis identified variables measuring specific latent attributes. Pearson's chi-square and Fisher's exact tests examined associations between categorical variables. Thematic analysis was performed for questionnaire open-ended responses. Results: Most (88\%) respondents worked in public health facilities with 71\% stationed in second-tier facilities. Regarding PC-NTDs, respondents perceived the surveillance system to be simple (55\%), acceptable (50\%), stable (41\%), flexible (41\%), useful (51\%) and to provide quality data (25\%). Facility locality, facility type, respondents' education level and years of work experience were associated with perceived opinion on acceptability (p = 0.046; p = 0.049; p = 0.032 and p = 0.032) and stability (p = 0.030; p = 0.022; p = 0.015 and p = 0.024) respectively. Median monthly reporting timeliness and completeness rates for facilities were 75 (58.3, 83.3) and 83.3 (58.3, 100) respectively. Higher-level facilities met reporting timeliness (p {$<$} 0.001) and completeness (p {$<$} 0.001) thresholds compared to lower-level facilities. Conclusion: Health personnel had lower perceptions on the stability, flexibility and data quality of the surveillance system considering PC-NTDs. Reporting timeliness and completeness rates decreased in 2017 compared to previous surveillance periods. Strengthening all surveillance functions would influence health workers' perceptions and improve surveillance system overall performance with regard to PC-NTDs.},

However, there is limited focus on diseases targeted for elimination or eradication, particularly preventive chemotherapy neglected tropical diseases (PC-NTDs). There are limited strategies to guide strengthening of surveillance and response system functions concerning PC-NTDs. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a framework to improve surveillance and response to PC-NTDs at the sub-national level in Kenya., METHODS: A multi-phased approach using descriptive cross-sectional mixed-method designs was adopted. Phase one involved a systematic literature review of surveillance assessment studies to derive generalised recommendations. Phase two utilised primary data surveys to identify disease-specific recommendations to improve PC-NTDs surveillance. The third phase utilised a Delphi survey to assess stakeholders' consensus on feasible recommendations. The fourth phase drew critical lessons from existing conceptual frameworks. The final validated framework was based on resolutions and inputs from concerned stakeholders., RESULTS: The first phase identified thirty studies that provided a combination of recommendations for improving surveillance functions. Second phase described PC-NTDs specific recommendations linked to simplified case definitions, enhanced laboratory capacity, improved reporting tools, regular feedback and supervision, enhanced training and improved system stability and flexibility. In the third phase, consensus was achieved on feasibility for implementing recommendations. Based on these recommendations, framework components constituted human, technical and organisational inputs, four process categories, ten distinct outputs, outcomes and overall impact encompassing reduced disease burden, halted disease transmission and reduced costs for implementing treatment interventions to achieve PC-NTDs control and elimination., CONCLUSION: In view of the mixed methodological approach used to develop the framework coupled with further inputs and consensus among concerned stakeholders, the validated framework is relevant for guiding decisions by policy makers to strengthen the existing surveillance and response system functions towards achieving PC-NTDs elimination.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Integrated antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance programmes require regular evaluation to ensure they are fit for purpose and that all actors understand their responsibilities. This will strengthen their relevance for the clinical setting, which depends heavily on continued access to effective treatment options. Several evaluation tools addressing different surveillance aspects are available., OBJECTIVES: The aim was to understand the strengths and weaknesses of three evaluation tools, and to improve guidance on how to choose a fit-for-purpose tool., SOURCES: Three tools were assessed: (a) AMR-PMP-the Progressive Management Pathway tool on AMR developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, (b) NEOH developed by the EU COST Action 'Network for Evaluation of One Health' and (c) SURVTOOLS developed in an FP7-EU project 'RISKSUR'. Each tool was assessed with regard to contents, required evaluation processes including stakeholder engagement and resource demands, integration coverage across relevant sectors and applicability. They were compared using a predefined scoring scheme and a strengths-weaknesses-opportunities-threats (SWOT)-like format for commenting., CONTENT: All three tools address multiple decision-making levels and aspects of stakeholder engagement. NEOH focuses on system features, learning, sharing, leadership and infrastructure, and requires a description of the underlying system in which AMR develops. AMR-PMP focuses on four areas: awareness, evidence, governance and practices and assesses the implementation degree of pre-chosen aspects within these areas. This requires less of the evaluator, but warrants participation of multiple stakeholders. SURVTOOL provides information and references on how to evaluate effectiveness, process and comprehensiveness of surveillance programmes. All three tools require veterinary epidemiology expertise and varying levels of evaluation methodology training to use appropriately., IMPLICATIONS: The tools covered AMR surveillance and One Health aspects to varying degrees. This study provides guidance on aspects to consider when choosing between available tools and embarking on an evaluation of integrated surveillance. Copyright {\copyright} 2020 The Authors.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The International Health Regulations outline core requirements to ensure the detection of public health threats of international concern. Assessing the capacity of surveillance systems to detect these threats is crucial for evaluating a country's ability to meet these requirements., METHODS AND FINDINGS: We propose a framework to evaluate the sensitivity and representativeness of hospital-based surveillance and apply it to severe neurological infectious diseases and fatal respiratory infectious diseases in Bangladesh. We identified cases in selected communities within surveillance hospital catchment areas using key informant and house-to-house surveys and ascertained where cases had sought care. We estimated the probability of surveillance detecting different sized outbreaks by distance from the surveillance hospital and compared characteristics of cases identified in the community and cases attending surveillance hospitals. We estimated that surveillance detected 26\% (95\% CI 18\%-33\%) of severe neurological disease cases and 18\% (95\% CI 16\%-21\%) of fatal respiratory disease cases residing at 10 km distance from a surveillance hospital. Detection probabilities decreased markedly with distance. The probability of detecting small outbreaks (three cases) dropped below 50\% at distances greater than 26 km for severe neurological disease and at distances greater than 7 km for fatal respiratory disease. Characteristics of cases attending surveillance hospitals were largely representative of all cases; however, neurological disease cases aged {$<$}5 y or from the lowest socioeconomic group and fatal respiratory disease cases aged {$>$}=60 y were underrepresented. Our estimates of outbreak detection rely on suspected cases that attend a surveillance hospital receiving laboratory confirmation of disease and being reported to the surveillance system. The extent to which this occurs will depend on disease characteristics (e.g., severity and symptom specificity) and surveillance resources., CONCLUSION: We present a new approach to evaluating the sensitivity and representativeness of hospital-based surveillance, making it possible to predict its ability to detect emerging threats.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nigeria is the only country in Africa that is yet to be certified as polio free. Surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) is the foundation of the polio eradication initiative since it provides information to alert both health managers and clinician that timely actions should be initiated to interrupt transmission of the polio virus. The strategy also provides evidence for the absence of wild poliovirus. This evaluation was performed to assess key quality indicators defined by the polio eradication program and thus to identify gaps to allow planning for corrective measures to achieve a polio-free situation in Bauchi state and in Nigeria at large. We conducted a cross-sectional descriptive study which involved a desk review of documents to authenticate the correctness and completeness of data, and a review of documented evidence for the quality of AFP surveillance. We interviewed Local Government Authority (LGA) surveillance officers and clinicians from focal and non-focal sites, along with caregivers of children with AFP and community leaders. The data were entered and analyzed in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet., METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of the AFP surveillance and documentation in eighteen of the twenty Local Government Areas (LGAs) of Bauchi State. We assessed the knowledge of the clinician at focal and non-focal sites on case definition of AFP, the number and method of stool specimen collection to investigate a case and types of training received for AFP surveillance. We verified AFP case investigations for the last three years: The caregivers (mothers) were interviewed to authenticate the reported information of AFP cases, the method used for stool specimen collection and feedbacks. Community leaders' knowledge on AFP surveillance was also assessed. Data was entered and analyzed in excel spread sheet., RESULTS: Of the 18 LGA Disease Surveillance and Notification Officers (DSNOs), only 2 (11\%) and 5 (28\%) had reports of polio outbreak investigations and supervisory visits at the lower levels, respectively. Furthermore, only 6 (33\%) and 7 (39\%) of the DSNOs had minutes of meetings and surveillance work plans, respectively. Of the 31 AFP cases investigated, only 39, 26, 23, and 23\% had correct and complete information for the birth day, birth month, date of onset of paralysis, and date of investigation, respectively. Seventy-one percent of the clinicians at the AFP focal sites knew the correct definition for AFP compared with only 30\% at the non-focal sites. Of the 38 caregivers (mothers), 16 (42\%) did not remember the day or month the AFP investigation was conducted. However, 95\% gave a correct number of stool samples collected and 40\% mentioned that the samples were collected 24 h apart. Feedback was not given to 26 (68\%) of the caregivers. The majority (79\%) of the community leaders knew how to recognize a case of AFP and knew that the stool was the specimen required for the investigation, but 21\% did not know to whom they should report a case of AFP in their community., CONCLUSION: This study revealed a gap in the quality indicators for polio eradication in the state, especially regarding knowledge and documentation for AFP surveillance at the operational level. Regular training of the DSNOs and focal persons, regular sensitization of clinicians, community education, supplies of reporting tools, and ensuring their judicious use will improve AFP surveillance in the state.},

  abstract = {Background: Nigeria is one of the three polio-endemic countries worldwide. Wild polio virus was reported last in Nigeria by August 2016 although pockets of circulating vaccine derived viruses' infection and vaccine associated paralytic polio still occur. As part of the polio endgame strategy Nigeria targets to achieve and sustain optimum surveillance performance indicators in all States by December 2018. We evaluated the acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance system in Enugu State to assess if the target for these indicators are being met. Methods and materials: We used an adapted US CDC Updated Guidelines for Evaluating Public Health Surveillance Systems. We reviewed of AFP surveillance data collected 2015-2018. We conducted key informant interviews and focus group discussion with purposively selected stakeholders. We collected data from 30 randomly selected AFP Surveillance officers in the state using an adapted questionnaire and recorded frequencies and proportions of key indicators. Result(s): One compatible poliovirus case was identified in 2015 among the 1211 AFP cases recorded. The case definition of AFP and tools for reporting are simple. The system is mainly funded by foreign partners although the main challenge is sustainability. The system is unstable as there are few trained staff who are regularly assigned other duties or transferred to other departments other than AFP surveillance. The system is flexible, and accepted by all stakeholders. The sensitivity of the system measured by the annualized Non-Polio AFP (NPAFP) rate is 15.1 +/- 2.7 (target of {$>$}=2/100,000 population). The mean data quality was 94\%, SD: 2.8 (target {$>$}=90). Mean stool adequacy and timeliness of reporting were 83.9 +/- 14.3\% and 91.0 +/- 8.6\% respectively both having target of {$>$}=80\%. Case investigations done in {$<$}=48 h: Mean 89 +/- 7.4, non-polio enterovirus isolation rate: Mean 39.5 +/- 19.4, target {$>$}10\% and 60 days follow up Mean 85.2 SD (17.0). Conclusion(s): Enugu State AFP surveillance is meeting most of its target although stability of the system is suboptimal. We recommended that Enugu state government train a pool of health officers on AFP surveillance and reduce staff mobility. Enugu state government should also plan to have a budget line for surveillance of AFP, and take ownership of the surveillance structure.Copyright {\copyright} 2020},

  abstract = {Background: Influenza is a common respiratory disease in Pakistan. However, the absence of a robust surveillance system makes it difficult to estimate the burden of disease. Purpose: We conducted this study to identify key strengths and weaknesses of the laboratory-based influenza surveillance system in Pakistan and to make recommendations for improvement. Methods: We conducted an evaluative descriptive study of the national laboratory-based influenza surveillance system from April to July 2017. We conducted this assessment using the updated guidelines for evaluating public health surveillance systems issued by CDC in 2011. Findings: The system was found to be simple and easy to operate, but with little flexibility to integrate with other pathogens and diseases. Data quality was good, given that 80\% of observed forms were completed. Timeliness was good, as it takes only 24-48 hours from sample collection to report a submission to the central level. Acceptability was good, since both private and public sector hospitals and labs are involved. Sensitivity was 62\% and positive predictive value (PPV) was 37.2\%. The representativeness of lab based influenza surveillance system was poor, since it is a sentinel surveillance system with specific, strategically placed reporting sites. Conclusions: The system meets its objectives. Sustainability and stability of the system needs to be improved by allocation of public funds. Coverage of the system should be expanded to improve representativeness. Regular capacity building with staff at reporting sites will ensure continued quality of reporting. {\copyright} 2019 The Author(s).},

Intensive care units (ICUs) may be an underused setting for public health surveillance. This study investigates the electronic Record for Intensive Care (eRIC), an electronic clinical information and management system being developed for New South Wales ICUs, and its surveillance opportunity offerings., METHODS: The surveillance benefits being introduced by the eRIC were evaluated through consultation with stakeholders and the eRIC program team. The consultation process involved providing stakeholders with background information about the eRIC system. Based on the consultation, a draft data and information model for surveillance was developed. The model was evaluated using guidelines from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention., RESULTS: Population health stakeholders confirmed that the eRIC offers an appealing surveillance data source for pathogens and other hazards causing severe illness. Suggested application of the surveillance included, for known hazards, seasonal and pandemic influenza, enterovirus 71, Murray Valley encephalitis virus, enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli 0104:H4 and parechovirus. The proposed surveillance model uses syndromic rather than specific-cause surveillance. It may offer greater timeliness and sensitivity than relying on reporting of diagnoses of specific pathogens. Five syndromes derived from clinical pathways in the eRIC are proposed: severe acute respiratory disease, severe acute neurological disease, sepsis or septicaemia, jaundice or hepatitis, and acute renal failure., CONCLUSION: New intensive care clinical information systems offer a largely untapped resource for continuous, mainstream, rapid ICU surveillance of severe illness. A continuous, mainstream, rapid ICU surveillance facility that will readily adapt to emergency situations would be a valuable resource for protecting population health. This study establishes a firm basis on which ICU surveillance can be developed.},

  abstract = {Introduction: There were 954 cases of diphtheria in 170 regencies or cities in 30 provinces in Indonesia with a CFR of 4.6\% in 2017 and 48\% of cases of diphtheria came from East Java. Kediri is one of the regencies that had been affected by the outbreak in January 2018 and found 19\% of toxigenic positive cases from 21 cases of diphtheria until May 2018. The diphtheria outbreak which occurred in the Kediri Regency had prompted the needs for the evaluation of the diphtheria surveillance system. Objective: The present study aimed at the evaluation of the simplicity attribute and indicators for the diphtheria surveillance performance in the Kediri Regency, East Java Province, in Indonesia. Methods: The present study was conducted from April 2018 to May 2018. The researchers carried out interviews with the stakeholders from the surveillance and immunization section of the Health Office in the Kediri Regency and conducted a retrospective record review of the diphtheria report, investigation form, and the laboratory report from January 2018 to May 2018. Also, the researchers adapted the 2001 CDC guidelines on surveillance to assess the simplicity and Indicators for the diphtheria surveillance performance from the guidelines for prevention and control of diphtheria from the Indonesian Ministry of Health, 2017. The results from the indicators were compared to WHO's (2017) that recommended performance indicators to accurately meet the objectives of the surveillance. Results: According to the stakeholders, the diphtheria surveillance system was simple in case finding, recording-reporting, and feedback, but it was not simple in the logistics support (Diphtheria Anti Toxin), specimen collection and data analysis. The indicators of the evaluated-surveillance performance comprised eight indicators, in which seven indicators had met the WHO target ({$>$}80\%), including completeness of reporting (100\%), timeliness of reporting (100\%), adequacy of investigation (100\%), timeliness of investigation (100\%), specimen collection (100\%), timeliness of specimen transport (90\%) and timeliness of reporting laboratory results (100\%). The indicators of the timeliness of specimen collection had not reached the target (42.85\%). Conclusion: This evaluation showed that the diphtheria surveillance system was simple, but not simple in the logistics support (Diphtheria Anti-Toxin), specimen collection and data analysis. Of the eight surveillance performance indicators, seven of them met the target ({$>$}80\%). {\copyright} Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya. All rights reserved.},

The 2 surveillance systems were compared to determine consistency across surveillance modalities and reveal the strengths and weaknesses of each to accomplish comprehensive influenza surveillance., DESIGN: Similar variables from the aggregate data collected from each system were compared and differences were analyzed in detail., SETTING: New York State., PARTICIPANTS: Hospitalized adult and pediatric patients detected through 2 influenza surveillance programs., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Significant differences in age distribution, timing of illness onset, illness complications, underlying medical conditions, critical care admissions, use of mechanical ventilation, and illness outcomes., RESULTS: Both surveillance systems saw the highest numbers of confirmed influenza infection among patients hospitalized in early fall 2009, with sharp declines thereafter. Sentinel hospital surveillance continued to detect hospitalizations for influenza-like illness that were not due to 2009 H1N1 influenza well into March 2010. Compared to influenza surveillance conducted through the Emerging Infections Program, the sentinel hospital influenza surveillance program tended to detect a sicker population of children and adults, including a higher rate of critical illness and mechanical ventilation, and among adults, higher rates of some underlying medical conditions. There were no differences in disease outcomes detected between the 2 systems., CONCLUSIONS: Although the 2 surveillance systems were complementary, inherent methodologic variations revealed important differences at season conclusion. The lessons learned should be used to determine the best way to allocate resources to meet the needs of future state and national influenza surveillance efforts.}

In 2017, the country developed and implemented a pilot of HIV case surveillance (CS) based on the 2017 World Health Organisation (WHO) person-centred HIV patient monitoring (PM) and case surveillance guidelines. At the end of the pilot phase an evaluation was conducted to inform further steps. The pilot was conducted in two districts (i.e., Umzingwane in Matabeleland South Province and Mutare in Manicaland Province) from August 2017 to December 2018. A mixed-methods cross-sectional study of stakeholders and health facility staff was used to assess the design and operations, performance, usefulness, sustainability, and scalability of the CS system. A total of 13 stakeholders responded to an online questionnaire, while 33 health facility respondents were interviewed in 11 health facilities in the two districts. The HIV CS system was adequately designed for Zimbabwe' s context, integrated within existing health information systems at the facility level. However, the training was minimal, and an opportunity to train the data entry clerks in data analysis was missed. The system performed well in terms of surveillance and informatics attributes. However, viral load test results return was a significant problem. The HIV CS system was found useful at the health facility level and should be rolled out in a phased manner, beginning in Manicaland and Matabeleland South provinces. An electronic link needs to be made between the health facilities and the laboratory to reduce viral load test results delays.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Influenza-like Illness (ILI) is a medical diagnosis of possible influenza or another respiratory illness with a common set of symptoms. The deaths of four schoolchildren, during a pandemic influenza outbreak in December 2017 in Ghana, raised doubts about the ILI surveillance system's performance. We evaluated the ILI surveillance system in the Greater Accra region, Ghana, to assess the system's attributes and its performance on set objectives., METHODS: CDC guidelines were used to evaluate the data of the ILI surveillance system between 2013 and 2017. We interviewed the surveillance personnel on the system's description and operation. Additionally, routinely entered ILI data from the National Influenza Center provided by the six sentinel sites in Accra was extracted. We sampled and reviewed 120 ILI case-investigation forms from these sites. Surveillance activities were examined on system's performance indicators, each being scored on a scale of 1 to 3 (poorest to best performance)., RESULTS: All population and age groups were under ILI surveillance over the period evaluated. Overall, 2948 suspected case-patients, including 392 (13.3\%) children under-five were reported, with 219 being positive for influenza virus (Predictive value positive = 7.4\%). The predominant influenza subtype was H3N2, recorded in 90 (41.1\%) of positive case-patients. The system only met two out of its four objectives. None of the six sentinel sites consistently met their annual 260 suspected case-detection quota. Samples reached the laboratory on average 48 hours after collection and results were disseminated within 7 days. Of 120 case-investigation forms sampled, 91 (76.3\%) were completely filled in., CONCLUSIONS: The ILI surveillance system in the Greater Accra region is only partially meeting its objectives. While it is found to be sensitive, representative and timely, the data quality was sub-optimal. We recommend the determination of thresholds for alert and outbreak detection and ensuring that sentinel sites meet their weekly case-detection targets.},

  abstract = {In the past ten years, the prevalence of primary Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) drug resistance has ranged from zero to 25\%, with higher and increasing rates in countries with access to antiretroviral therapy (ART), a specific case in Mozambique. World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that countries implement and routinely evaluate representative HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) research to monitor the emergency and transmission of HIV drug resistance mutations. This study aimed to describe the functioning of the system and also to identify gaps in the sensitivity, representativeness and quality of the data using the WHO methodology for Pre-Treatment and Acquired Approaches. We conducted a descriptive evaluation of the information system for surveillance of HIVDR in Mozambique in 2017-2018, based on updated guidelines for evaluating of public health surveillance systems from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The evaluation was conducted in all provinces using secondary data extracted from a cross-sectional survey database on HIVDR, with HIV positive cases at the beginning of ART aged {$>$}=15 years. The system was described through informal conversations with HIVDR stakeholders and the simplicity, data quality and representativeness attributes were evaluated. With 322 positive cases at the beginning of ART (mean age=32.5 years, SD+/-11.1), about 63.0\% (203/322) cases were women and 37.6\% (121/322) men. The system was implemented in 25 health facilities distributed across all 11 Mozambican provinces and was considered representative. The system used two data collection instruments, the ART book and the form accompanying samples sent to the reference laboratory. The ART form, with 27 variables, was sent offline at two levels (health facility and National Institute of Health (NHI)), accompanied by dried blood spot samples for viral load testing and genotyping in the NHI virology laboratory, and was considered simple according to the standardized criteria. The system's data quality was considered regular at 79.9\%, with about 59.8\% (1156/1932) of variable fields completed and 100\% (1932/1932) consistency. The system used a single national laboratory to measure the prevalence of resistance to HIV drugs and was considered simple, with regular quality and representative data. We recommended public health efforts such as conducting genotyping tests be expanded to the provincial level, and periodic monitoring of system's data collection procedures using forms.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ghana recorded the last case of indigenous wild poliovirus in 1999 but suffered two more outbreaks in 2003 and 2008. Following the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, transmission was interrupted through high routine immunisation coverage with live-attenuated oral polio vaccine (OPV), effective acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance and supplementary immunisation activities (SIA). This article describes the results of a five-year surveillance of AFP in polio-free Ghana, evaluate the surveillance indicators and identify areas that need improvement., METHODS: We investigated 1345 cases of AFP from children aged less than 15 years reported to the Disease Surveillance Department from January 2009 to December 2013. Data on demographic characteristics, vaccination history, clinical presentation and virological investigation on stool specimens collected during investigation were analysed., RESULTS: Of the specimens analysed, 56\% were from males and 76.3\% were from children less than 5 years of age. Twenty-four percent of the children received up to 3 doses of OPV, 57\% received at least 4 doses while the status of 19\% was unknown. Core AFP surveillance indicators were partly met for non-polio AFP rate while the WHO target for stool adequacy and timeliness was exceeded over the period of study. All the cases were classified virologically, however no wild polio was found. Sixty-day follow-up was conducted for 56.3\% of cases and 8.6\% cases classified as compactible with polio., CONCLUSION: Both laboratory and epidemiological surveillance for AFP were efficient and many WHO targets were met. However, due to the risk of poliovirus importation prior to global eradication, longterm surveillance is required to provide a high degree of confidence in prevention of poliovirus infection in Ghana. Thus, efforts should be made to strengthen regional performance and to follow-up on all AFP cases in order to establish proper diagnoses for the causes of the AFP leading to proper care.}

Although various methods have been proposed for quantitative evaluation of surveillance results, no methods focusing on surveillance from a qualitative perspective have yet been established. The authors have developed an objective method for evaluating the qualitative aspects of BSE surveillance, based on the analytic hierarchy process. Factors related to surveillance credibility were selected through expert meetings and arranged in a hierarchical structure. These evaluation factors were also weighted, so that a points system could be used for evaluation. As a result, 13 evaluation factors comprising three-layer hierarchies were generated. When surveillance in Japan before and after a BSE case was evaluated using this evaluation system, an improvement in the quality of the surveillance was observed after the outbreak. Although this study suggests that the selection of the experts had a significant effect on the outcome, the authors believe that this method will also be applicable for establishing qualitative evaluation systems for other diseases.},

We performed a questionnaire-based survey to 164 acute care general hospitals throughout the Republic of Korea that had more than 300 beds. Study methods were based completely on those of the Study on the Efficacy of Nosocomial Infection Control (SENIC). Four SENIC indices (hospital epidemiologist index, infection control nurse index, surveillance index, and control index) and 4 newly developed indices (healthcare worker index, quality improvement index, resource index, and hand hygiene facilities index) were used to evaluate Korean ISCPs. Data were collected by questionnaire from June 17 to October 11, 2003. SETTING. One hundred sixty-four general hospitals with more than 300 beds in the Republic of Korea. RESULTS. Personnel from 85 general hospitals responded to the study questionnaire. The reliability and validity of the evaluation indices were statistically significant (P{$<$}.05). The 8 evaluation indices were categorized into 2 factor groups: personnel factors (hospital epidemiologist index and infection control nurse index) and activity factors (the remaining 6 indices). Korean ISCPs showed a major weakness in surveillance. The scores for the newly developed evaluation indices were better than those for the SENIC evaluation indices. However, most Korean hospitals were estimated to have had only slight reductions in nosocomial infection rates. The evaluation indices were influenced significantly by the number of beds in the hospital, whether the hospital was located in the Seoul-Gyonggi region, the presence of full-time infection control nurses at the hospital, the education level of the infection control nurses, and the nurses' experience in infection control (P{$<$}.05). CONCLUSIONS. The reliability and validity of the SENIC evaluation indices and the newly developed evaluation indices were satisfactory in evaluating Korean ISCPs. However, surveillance should be improved to increase the efficacy of Korean ISCPs.},

To evaluate the media-reported data, vital statistics records of Sandy-related deaths were compared to corresponding media-reported deaths and assessed for percentage match. Sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), and timeliness of the media reports for detecting Sandy-related deaths were calculated., RESULTS: Ninety-nine media-reported deaths were identified and compared with the 90 vital statistics death records sent to the CDC by New York City (NYC) and the 5 states that agreed to participate in this study. Seventy-five (76\%) of the media reports matched with vital statistics records. Only NYC was able to actively track Sandy-related deaths during the event. Moderate sensitivity (83\%) and PPV (83\%) were calculated for the matching media-reported deaths for NYC., CONCLUSIONS: During Hurricane Sandy, the media-reported information was moderately sensitive, and percentage match with vital statistics records was also moderate. The results indicate that online media-reported deaths can be useful as a supplemental source of information for situational awareness and immediate public health decision-making during the initial response stage of a disaster.

However, sampling bias is a concern because inferences from nonrandom data can be misleading. In March 2021, the Washington State Department of Health, USA, partnered with submitting and sequencing laboratories to establish sentinel surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 genomic data. We analyzed available genomic and epidemiologic data during presentinel and sentinel periods to assess representativeness and timeliness of availability. Genomic data during the presentinel period was largely unrepresentative of all COVID-19 cases. Data available during the sentinel period improved representativeness for age, death from COVID-19, outbreak association, long-term care facility-affiliated status, and geographic coverage; timeliness of data availability and captured viral diversity also improved. Hospitalized cases were underrepresented, indicating a need to increase inpatient sampling. Our analysis emphasizes the need to understand and quantify sampling bias in phylogenetic studies and continue evaluation and improvement of public health surveillance systems.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Meningococcal infection causes severe, rapidly progressing illness and reporting of cases is mandatory in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. The NSW Department of Health operates near real-time Emergency Department (ED) surveillance that includes capture and statistical analysis of clinical preliminary diagnoses. The system can provide alerts in response to specific diagnoses entered in the ED computer system. This study assessed whether once daily reporting of clinical diagnoses of meningococcal infection using the ED surveillance system provides an opportunity for timelier public health response for this disease., METHODS: The study involved a prospective and retrospective component. First, reporting of ED diagnoses of meningococcal infection from the ED surveillance system prospectively operated in parallel with conventional surveillance which requires direct telephone reporting of this scheduled medical condition to local public health authorities by hospitals and laboratories when a meningococcal infection diagnosis is made. Follow-up of the ED diagnoses determined whether meningococcal infection was confirmed, and the time difference between ED surveillance report and notification by conventional means. Second, cases of meningococcal infection reported by conventional surveillance during 2004 were retrospectively matched to ED visits to determine the sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) of ED surveillance., RESULTS: During the prospective evaluation, 31 patients were diagnosed with meningococcal infection in participating EDs. Of these, 12 had confirmed meningococcal disease, resulting in a PPV of 38.7\%. All confirmed cases were notified earlier to public health authorities by conventional reporting.Of 149 cases of notified meningococcal disease identified retrospectively, 130 were linked to an ED visit. The sensitivity and PPV of the ED diagnosis for meningococcal infection was 36.2\% and 36.7\%, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Based on prospective evaluation, it is reassuring that existing mechanisms for reporting meningococcal infection perform well and are timely. The retrospective evaluation found low sensitivity and PPV of ED diagnoses for meningococcal disease. Even if more rapid forwarding of ED meningococcal diagnoses to public health authorities were possible, the low sensitivity and PPV do not justify this. In this study, use of an ED surveillance system to augment conventional surveillance of this scheduled medical condition did not demonstrate a benefit.}

To reduce the burden of equine infectious diseases internationally, it is important to collect, review, and distribute equine health surveillance data as accurate and timely as possible. Within this study, we aimed at providing a comprehensive descriptive analysis of data submitted to Equinella, a voluntary veterinary-based surveillance system of non-notifiable equine infectious diseases and clinical signs, in Switzerland. This was achieved by reviewing the reports submitted since its relaunch in November 2013 and until April 2019, as well as assessing the data validity, activeness of participating veterinarians, coverage of the equine population, geographical representativeness, and timeliness of the system. In total, 630 reports have been submitted. Data validity ranged between 88.2 and 100\%. The coverage of Equinella was assessed to be 50.8\% of the Swiss equine population. Over the 5.5 years, of all 102 registered veterinarians, 67 (65.7\%) submitted at least one report. On average, these veterinarians submitted 1.7 reports per year (median = 4 reports). More recently, in 2018, approximately only one-third [29 (28.4\%)] of all registered veterinarians submitted at least one report. However, 59 (57.8\%) have responded to the monthly reminder emails to confirm that they have not observed any relevant clinical case to be reported at least once (median number of confirmation per veterinarian = 9 of 12 reminder emails). The incidence of reports varied between cantons (member states of the Swiss confederation). The median timeliness of report submission was found to be 7 days. Overall, Equinella has been receiving reports since its initiation and contributed continuously to the surveillance of infectious diseases in the Swiss equine population and provided an output for the international equine community. Challenges encountered in achieving a higher number of submitted reports and increasing the coverage of the equine population, as well as the overall activeness of veterinarians, require further work. With our study, we provide a comprehensive overview of a veterinary-based voluntary surveillance system for equine health, assessed challenges of such, and suggest concrete improvements with transdisciplinary approaches for similar veterinary-based surveillance systems.

  abstract = {Aim of the study was to assess the current state of implementating key aspects of infection prevention and control (IPC) in Armenian hospitals, defined by the main WHO components, using the survey tool IPCAF (Infection Prevention and Control Assessment Framework). Materials and methods. 113 hospitals were involved in the study. All participants filled out the IPCAF questionnaire, consisting of 8 sections (each rated up to 100 points) devoted to various IPC aspects. Depending on the total final score, IPC programs were divided into the following categories: advanced (601-800 points), intermediate (401-600 points), basic (201-400 points) and inadequate (0-200 points). The study conducted a descriptive analysis of the overall IPCAF score as well as score evaluation of the relevant core components and some selected questions of particular interest. Results. The 2021 total average score for all IPCAF components for all hospitals in Armenia is 578.0+/-7.9 points, which is currently regarded as an "intermediate" level. At the same time, 47 (41.6\%) hospitals were assigned to the advanced category, 63 (55.7\%) - to the average category and 3 (2.7\%) - to the basic category. Analysis of the main IPC components (CC, Core component) revealed that the maximum average scores were obtained for the components CC2 (IPC Guidelines) - 80.8 points, CC8 (Creating a safe environment in medical premises, as well as materials and equipment for IPC) - 75.5 points and CC7 (Workload, staffing and number of beds) - 75.2 points. The lowest average scores were obtained for the key components: CC4 (Surveillance for healthcare-associated infections) with 54.7 points and CC3 (IPC education and training) with 59.5 points. Conclusion. Legislative and practical changes implemented in the real world during the novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) pandemic have significantly contributed to improved scores for many key components of IPC programs. The study found that the IPCAF is a useful tool for assessing IPC standards and identifying gaps, regardless of a country economic development level. In our opinion, the re-use of IPCAF in all medical institutions should be encouraged, which is important for monitoring changes and trends in IPC, as well as proposing individual strategies in the development and improvement of IPC.Copyright {\copyright} 2022 Saint Petersburg Pasteur Institute.

In Pennsylvania, reporting of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) was mandated in 2007, and hospitals were encouraged to implement qualified electronic surveillance (QES) systems to assist HAI detection. This study evaluated the usefulness of these systems in reducing HAIs. Design. Online survey and retrospective cohort study. Eligible facilities had a QES or manual system in place for the entire study period and sufficient data in selected hospital units. Methods. Surveys were sent to infection preventionists (IPs) in all Pennsylvania hospitals to gather qualitative information about their systems. National Healthcare Safety Network data from Pennsylvania hospitals for July 2008 through June 2010 were used to compare catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) rates in facilities with and without a QES system. participants. IPs from 174 facilities responded to the survey. Data from 119 of 234 hospitals were analyzed. Results. IPs in facilities with a QES system reported spending as much time on data management and education as IPs in hospitals with manual surveillance. Significant interaction was observed in CAUTI rates over time between groups of facilities with and without a QES system after controlling for device-utilization ratio, location within hospital, and licensed bed size (P{$<$} 01). QES hospitals showed a significant decline in CAUTI rates (P{$<$}.01); manual surveillance facilities showed no change in rates (P{$>$} 1.05). Conclusions. Over the 2-year period, a significant decline in CAUTI rates was observed in facilities with a QES system. This suggests that electronic systems may aid in reducing HAI rates. Additional data are needed to see whether these improvements and trends persist. {\copyright} 2011 by The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America.}

  abstract = {An outbreak surveillance system for Salmonella integrating whole genome sequencing (WGS) and epidemiological data was developed in South East and London in 2016-17 to assess local WGS clusters for triage and investigation. Cases genetically linked within a 5 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) single linkage cluster were assessed using a set of locally agreed thresholds based on time, person and place, for reporting to local health protection teams (HPTs). Between September 2016 and September 2017, 230 unique 5-SNP clusters (442 weekly reports) of non-typhoidal Salmonella 5-SNP WGS clusters were identified, of which 208 unique 5-SNP clusters (316 weekly reports) were not reported to the HPTs. In the remaining 22 unique clusters (126 weekly clusters) reported to HPTs, nine were known active outbreak investigations, seven were below locally agreed thresholds and six exceeded local thresholds. A common source or vehicle was identified in four of six clusters that exceeded locally agreed thresholds. This work demonstrates that a threshold-based surveillance system, taking into account time, place and genetic relatedness, is feasible and effective in directing the use of local public health resources for risk assessment and investigation of non-typhoidal Salmonella clusters.},

  abstract = {Background: Optimizing antimicrobial use (AMU) is key to reducing antimicrobial-resistant infections, but current AMU monitoring in hospital provides limited insights for quality improvement. Objective(s): To understand stakeholders' priorities for developing national AMU surveillance in English hospitals to serve the needs of national policy makers and front-line practitioners. Method(s): Characteristics of existing AMU surveillance systems were identified from a previous systematic review and categorized by the Acceptability, Practicability, Effectiveness, Affordability, Side-effects and Equity (APEASE) criteria. Stakeholders prioritized characteristics using a two-round RAND-modified Delphi (rating round 1, telephone panel discussion, rating round 2). Findings informed the design of a framework used to assess the extent to which existing surveillance approaches meet stakeholders' needs. Result(s): Between 17/09/19 and 01/11/19, 24 stakeholders with national and local roles related to AMU prioritized 23 characteristics of AMU surveillance describing: resource for surveillance, data collection, data availability and pathways to translate information from surveillance into practice. No existing surveillance approaches demonstrated all prioritized characteristics. The most common limitation was failure to facilitate clinician engagement with AMU through delays in data access and/or limited availability of disaggregated metrics of prescribing. Conclusion(s): Current surveillance delivers national public health priorities but improving stewardship demands patient-level data linked to clinical outcomes. This study offers a framework to develop current surveillance to meet the needs of local stakeholders in England. Increased investment in data infrastructure and training is essential to make information held within electronic systems available to front-line clinicians to facilitate quality improvement.Copyright {\copyright} 2022 The Author(s).

  abstract = {West Nile virus (WNV) is endemic in the Po valley area, Northern Italy, and within the legal framework of the national plan for the surveillance of human vector-borne diseases, WNV surveillance has over time been implemented. The surveillance plans are based on the transdisciplinary and trans-sectorial collaboration between regional institutions involved in public, animal, and environmental health. This integrated surveillance targets mosquitoes, wild birds, humans, and horses and aims at early detecting the viral circulation and reducing the risk of infection in the human populations. The objective of our study was to assess the degree of One Health (OH) implementation (OH-ness) of the WNV surveillance system in three North Italian regions (Emilia-Romagna, Lombardy, Piedmont) in 2016, following the evaluation protocol developed by the Network for Evaluation of One Health (NEOH). In detail, we (i) described the OH initiative (drivers, outcomes) and its system (boundaries, aim, dimensions, actors, stakeholders) and (ii) scored different aspects of this initiative (i.e., OH-thinking, -planning, -sharing, -learning, transdisciplinarity and leadership), with values from 0 (=no OH approach) to 1 (=perfect OH approach). We obtained a mean score for each aspect evaluated. We reached high scores for OH thinking (0.90) and OH planning (0.89). Lower scores were attributed to OH sharing (0.83), transdisciplinarity and leadership (0.77), and OH learning (0.67), highlighting some critical issues related to communication and learning gaps. The strengths and weaknesses detected by the described quantitative evaluation will be investigated in detail by a qualitative evaluation (process evaluation), aiming to provide a basis for the development of shared recommendations to refine the initiative and conduct it in a more OH-oriented perspective.},

  abstract = {Objective: The Manitoba Infant Feeding Database (MIFD) is being piloted as a surveillance system leveraging infant vaccination visits as a point of contact to collect infant feeding data during the first year of life. The objective of this study was to assess data quality and acceptability of the MIFD as a sustainable population-based surveillance system. Methods: Internal completeness and internal validity were measured to assess data quality. Internal completeness was defined as the number of completed data fields out of the total number of data fields. Internal validity was defined as the proportion of translation errors from one level of the system, the paper questionnaire, to the next, the electronic database. A survey assessed staff's acceptance of data collection and submission processes. Results: A total of 947 records were reviewed. Data were 98.5\% complete. Discrepancies were noted in 13.5\% of data. The survey response rate was 78.4\%. Nearly all respondents reported that the MIFD data collection tool was easy to use (96.6\% agreed or strongly agreed). Whereas some challenges were identified, the majority were willing to continue with the MIFD data collection tool and process (93.1\%). Conclusion: Results from this evaluation suggest that the MIFD data collection process worked well; however, data validation will require human resources. The MIFD approach provides a sustainable mechanism for collecting data on infant feeding for surveillance and research purposes.},

  abstract = {Background Limited and fragmented data collection systems exist for burn injury. A global registry may lead to better injury estimates and identify risk factors. A collaborative effort involving the WHO, the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves, the CDC and the International Society for Burn Injuries was undertaken to simplify and standardise inpatient burn data collection. An expert panel of epidemiologists and burn care practitioners advised on the development of a new Global Burn Registry (GBR) form and online data entry system that can be expected to be used in resourceabundant or resource-limited settings. Methods International burn organisations, the CDC and the WHO solicited burn centre participation to pilot test the GBR system. The WHO and the CDC led a webinar tutorial for system implementation. Results During an 8-month period, 52 hospitals in 30 countries enrolled in the pilot and were provided the GBR instrument, guidance and a data visualisation tool. Evaluations were received from 29 hospitals (56\%). Key findings Median time to upload completed forms was {$<$}10 min; physicians most commonly entered data (64\%), followed by nurses (25\%); layout, clarity, accuracy and relevance were all rated high; and a vast majority (85\%) considered the GBR `highly valuable' for prioritising, developing and monitoring burn prevention programmes. Conclusions The GBR was shown to be simple, flexible and acceptable to users. Enhanced regional and global understanding of burn epidemiology may help prioritise the selection, development and testing of primary prevention interventions for burns in resourcelimited settings. {\copyright} 2016, BMJ Publishing Group.

  abstract = {Multisectoral, One Health collaboration is essential for addressing national and international health threats that arise at the human-animal-environment interface. Thanks to the efforts of multiple organisations, countries now have an array of One Health tools available to assess capacities within and between sectors, plan and prioritise activities, and strengthen multisectoral, One Health coordination, communication, and collaboration. By doing so, they are able to address health threats at the human-animal-environment interface, including emerging zoonotic and infectious diseases, more efficiently. However, to ensure optimal outcomes for the countries using these One Health tools, the partners responsible for implementation should regularly collaborate and share information such as implementation timelines, results and lessons learned, so that one process can inform the next. This paper presents a consensus framework on how commonly implemented One Health tools might align to best support countries in strengthening One Health systems. Twelve One Health tools were selected based on their high implementation rates, authors' experience with these tools and their focus on multisectoral, One Health coordination. Through a four-step process, the authors: a) jointly carried out a landscape analysis of One Health tools, using a Cloudbased spreadsheet to share the unique characteristics and applications of each tool; b) performed an implementation analysis to identify and share implementation dynamics and identify respective outcomes and synergies; c) jointly created a consensus conceptual model of how the authors suggest the tools might logically work together; and d) extrapolated from steps 1-3 an agreed-upon overarching conceptual framework for how current and future One Health tools could be categorised to best support One Health system strengthening at the national level. Highlighted One Health tools include the States Parties Annual Reporting Tool under the International Health Regulations (IHR), the World Organisation for Animal Health Performance of Veterinary Services (PVS) Pathway, the Joint External Evaluation process, IHR/PVS National Bridging Workshops, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention One Health Zoonotic Disease Prioritization Tool, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Laboratory Mapping Tool, the FAO Assessment Tool for Laboratories and Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Systems, the FAO Surveillance Evaluation Tool, the One Health Systems Mapping and Analysis Resource Toolkit, the National Action Plan for Health Security, and IHR Monitoring and Evaluation Framework tools for After Action Reviews and Simulation Exercises. A new guidance document entitled, Taking a Multisectoral, One Health Approach: A Tripartite Guide to Addressing Zoonotic Diseases in Countries was also included as a framework that provides guidance to support the implementation of the outputs of the tools described.},

The exhaustibility of the laboratory has been 82\%, 95\% confidence interval (76-87\%) and that of the EDO system 45\%, 95\% confidence interval (38-52\%). The rate kappa for the diseases global is 0.42 95\%, confidence interval (0.4-0.43) and the specific accordance proportion 0.27, 95\% confidence interval (0.21-0.34). The cases search in the recording of the laboratory increases the incidence declared to the EDO system in all the diseases. The diseases with greater incidence are the hepatitis (73.59 x 10(5)), the pulmonary tuberculosis (27.07 x 10(5)) and the syphilis (18.05 x 10(5))., CONCLUSIONS: The EDO system presents a clear understatement, variable according to the different diseases and being maximum for the hepatitis B and C. The laboratory quantifies a high exhaustibility, and it can increase between 55 and 30\% the EDO recording cases, increasing the knowledge of the morbidity caused by EDO in the Area 11. The valuation of the EDO in addition to improving the information for the assumptions of decisions in sanitary planning, optimizes the necessary elements when it is compared the EDO incidence among different geographical areas or within a same area at a different time.},

  abstract = {Objective: This study provides an assessment of completeness of cancer surveillance and incidence estimates for all malignancies, Hodgkin's lymphoma and thyroid cancer in the Italian army, for the years 2001-2007. Methods: The two-source capture-recapture method was employed, using both Chapman's and Chao's formulae, on the basis of cancer notifications from military hospitals and unit infirmaries. The estimated incident cases were then confronted with the corresponding expected cases; the standardized incidence ratios and 95\% confidence intervals (SIR [95\% CI]) were then calculated. Results: A total of 442 cancer notifications, concerning 371 cases, were reported (311 from army hospitals and 131 from unit infirmaries; of these, 71 were overlapping). The estimated total number of cases, by Chapman's and Chao's formulae, was 571 and 688, respectively. Overall, sensitivity of the surveillance system was 65\% by Chapman's and 54\% by Chao's estimators. Completeness of notification was significantly higher in younger patients, in those previously deployed in Bosnia or Kosovo, and for cases of Hodgkin's lymphoma. Estimated SIRs, using both formulae, were not significant for all malignancies and Hodgkin's lymphoma, but significant for thyroid cancer (SIR: 2.25 [1.61-2.89] by Chapman's formula, and 3.12 [1.81-4.43] by Chao's estimator). Conclusion: Completeness of cancer registry of the Italian military is low, and methods to improve its sensitivity are discussed. Overall, the estimated number of incident cancer cases, including Hodgkin's lymphoma, is not significantly higher than expected, except thyroid cancer. The increased incidence of this malignancy requires further investigation; however, in the military, as well as in the general population, this may be partly due to the growing availability of diagnostic opportunities in the last decades. Moreover, detection of thyroid cancer may be further facilitated by a selection bias generated by the annual and pre-/post-deployment medical examinations and blood tests routinely performed on all military personnel.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mortality registries are an essential data source for public health surveillance and for planning and evaluating public policy. Nevertheless, there are still large inequalities in the completeness and quality of mortality registries between and within countries. In Ecuador, there have been few nationwide evaluations of the mortality registry and no evaluations of inequalities between provinces. This kind of analysis is fundamental for strengthening the vital statistics system., METHODS: Ecological study assessing the completeness, quality and internal consistency of mortality data in the provinces of Ecuador, using 13 years of mortality data (2001-2013). Completeness was assessed using three types of death distribution methods (DDMs), quality by estimating the percentages of garbage codes and deaths with unspecified age or sex in the registered deaths, and internal consistency by estimating the percentage of deaths with reported causes of deaths considered impossible in some age-sex combinations. Finally, we propose a classification of the mortality registry in the studied areas based on completeness and quality., RESULTS: Completeness estimates (mean of the three methods used) in the provinces ranged from 21 to 87\% in women and from 35 to 89\% in men. The percentage of garbage codes in the provinces ranged from 21 to 56\% in women and from 25 to 52\% in men. Garbage coding was higher in women and in older age groups. The percentage of deaths with unspecified age or sex, and the percentage of deaths with reported causes of deaths considered impossible in some age-sex combinations was low in all the studied areas. The mortality registry could only be classified as acceptable in one area for men and one area for women., CONCLUSIONS: We found substantial inequalities by sex, geographical areas and age in the completeness and quality of the mortality registry of Ecuador. The findings of this study will be helpful to direct measures to improve Ecuador's vital statistics system and to generate strategies to reduce bias when using mortality data to analyse health inequalities in the country.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the validity of information in the rubella surveillance system in Quebec. DATA AND METHODS: Cases of rubella in the provincial registry of notifiable diseases, "Maladies a declaration obligatoire" (MADO), from 1994 to 1996 were matched with laboratory-identified cases and with cases in a reference file created from all case investigation records of regional departments of public health for the same period. Sensitivity and the proportion of cases in agreement were calculated. RESULT(S): Compared with laboratories, the sensitivity of the provincial registry was 56\%. Compared with the reference file, global sensitivity (confirmed cases plus clinical cases) was 58\% and the positive predictive value was 50\%. Of the 356 cases reported to regional public health departments, 65\% were classified in the same diagnostic category (confirmed case, clinical case, excluded case) by public health professionals and a group of experts (weighted kappa=0.32). Information on rubella vaccination status was missing in 25\% of cases in the MADO file for rubella. CONCLUSION(S): Notification of positive results for immunoglobulin M antibodies and viral cultures should be required of all laboratories. Uniform procedures should be adopted and applied for the validation of cases that are reported to regional departments of public health. In the context of the rarefaction of rubella, any immunoglobulin M-positive result should be interpreted using all available epidemiological information.}

Ascertainment of invasive S. pneumoniae infection cases by each system in 1998 was evaluated, and completeness of reporting, antibiotic resistance patterns, costs, and other attributes were compared. The county-sponsored system collects patient identifiers and drug susceptibility data directly from hospital laboratories, whereas the CDC-sponsored system performs medical chart abstractions and reference laboratory susceptibility testing. Similar numbers of invasive S. pneumoniae cases were detected by the county-sponsored (n = 127) and CDC-sponsored (n = 123) systems; these systems held {$>$}=75\% of all cases in common, and each system achieved {$>$}=85\% sensitivity. Conventional reporting contained 88\% and 76\% of the DRSP cases identified by the county- and CDC-sponsored systems, respectively, but did not capture infections produced by susceptible isolates. Both the county- and CDC-sponsored systems indicated that large proportions of isolates were resistant to penicillin and extended-spectrum cephalosporins. The county-sponsored DRSP surveillance system was inexpensive, simple to execute, and relevant to local needs.}

  abstract = {Objective: The objective of this paper is to describe the updated methodological guidance for conducting a JBI scoping review, with a focus on new updates to the approach and development of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (the PRISMA-ScR). Introduction: Scoping reviews are an increasingly common approach to informing decision-making and research based on the identification and examination of the literature on a given topic or issue. Scoping reviews draw on evidence from any research methodology and may also include evidence from non-research sources, such as policy. In this manner, scoping reviews provide a comprehensive overview to address broader review questions than traditionally more specific systematic reviews of effectiveness or qualitative evidence. The increasing popularity of scoping reviews has been accompanied by the development of a reporting guideline: the PRISMA-ScR. In 2014, the JBI Scoping Review Methodology Group developed guidance for scoping reviews that received minor updates in 2017 and was most recently updated in 2020. The updates reflect ongoing and substantial developments in approaches to scoping review conduct and reporting. As such, the JBI Scoping Review Methodology Group recognized the need to revise the guidance to align with the current state of knowledge and reporting standards in evidence synthesis. Methods: Between 2015 and 2020, the JBI Scoping Review Methodology Group expanded its membership; extensively reviewed the literature; engaged via annual face-to-face meetings, regular teleconferences, and email correspondence; sought advice from methodological experts; facilitated workshops; and presented at scientific conferences. This process led to updated guidance for scoping reviews published in the JBI Manual for Evidence Synthesis. The updated chapter was endorsed by JBI's International Scientific Committee in 2020. Results: The updated JBI guidance for scoping reviews includes additional guidance on several methodological issues, such as when a scoping review is (or is not) appropriate, and how to extract, analyze, and present results, and provides clarification for implications for practice and research. Furthermore, it is aligned with the PRISMA-ScR to ensure consistent reporting. Conclusions: The latest JBI guidance for scoping reviews provides up-to-date guidance that can be used by authors when conducting a scoping review. Furthermore, it aligns with the PRISMA-ScR, which can be used to report the conduct of a scoping review. A series of ongoing and future methodological projects identified by the JBI Scoping Review Methodology Group to further refine the methodology are planned.},

  abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this article is to clearly describe how to develop a robust and detailed scoping review protocol, which is the first stage of the scoping review process. This paper provides detailed guidance and a checklist for prospective authors to ensure that their protocols adequately inform both the conduct of the ensuing review and their readership. Introduction: Scoping reviews are a common approach to evidence synthesis for researchers, clinicians, and policymakers across a variety of fields. Scoping reviews are not concerned with making analytical comparisons based on pooling results data from multiple primary sources of evidence, but rather on collating and describing the evidence and presenting the summation in a clearly illustrated format. Methods for undertaking and reporting scoping reviews continue to be refined. Some prospective reviewers may be uncertain how to plan, structure, and report scoping review protocols, as there is little or no specific guidance for scoping review protocols yet available. Methods: This guidance was developed by members of the JBI Scoping Review Methodology Group based on previous experience and expertise in developing scoping review and evidence synthesis methodologies, protocols, and reviews, as well as through experiences working with and guiding authors to develop scoping review protocols. Elements of a comprehensive scoping review protocol are outlined and explained in detail. Conclusion: Knowledge users of evidence syntheses rely on clear and transparent reporting to understand and use the results of published work to drive evidence-based improvements within health care and beyond. It is hoped that readers will be able to use this guidance when developing protocols to assist them in planning future scoping reviews and to carry them out with a high degree of transparency.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Saving Mothers, Giving Life (SMGL) is a public-private partnership which aims to reduce maternal mortality by using a comprehensive approach with interventions at the community, facility, and district levels. Maternal Death Surveillance and Response (MDSR) is an effective process designed to monitor and respond to maternal deaths and evaluate the impact of actions towards reduction of maternal death. MDSR was implemented in Phase 1 of the SMGL initiative in 4 districts in Uganda, integrated with the Uganda Ministry of Health's community health platform. We assessed the MDSR system to provide recommendations for future actions to inform implementation, feasibility and utilization. Method(s): We used a mixed-methods approach based on the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Guidelines for Evaluating Surveillance Systems. We evaluated the surveillance system for simplicity, flexibility, acceptability, sensitivity, predictive value positive, timeliness, and usefulness of data. For qualitative assessment, we assessed current activities and interviewed staff and stakeholders to evaluate current practices, difficulties, and future goals. For quantitative assessment, we analyzed data collected from the maternal death surveillance system, and compared it to a gold standard Reproductive Age Mortality Study conducted for the same period of time covered by MDSR (June 2012-May 2013). Result(s): Usefulness of the MDSR system was high; findings of reduction of maternal mortality, confirmed by the gold standard, demonstrated a proof of concept for the SMGL model. The system was flexible, highly acceptable, and highly representative (98\% of villages in the 4 districts participated). Data quality was relatively good, with item-nonresponse of 20\% and duplication of records of3\%. Sensitivity and positive predictive value were moderate (72\%, 73\%). Timeliness was poor with 0 cases meeting established guidelines for rapid notification and reporting. Stability was moderate; financial resources lapsed and led to interruptions in data collection. Conclusion(s): This assessment shows MDSR is feasible at the community level through a well-coordinated effort. This system was implemented successfully in a short time period, possible because of integration with existing Uganda Ministry of Health community health system. Strengths of the system include representativeness, acceptability, and usefulness. Further efforts should focus on improving sensitivity, timeliness, and data quality by continuing building capacity of data collectors, standardizing protocols, and introducing an informatics system. The "R" component of MDSR should be strengthened by formalizing district review and response committees. The MDSR system should be expanded to other areas of Uganda.}

This work has allowed to better understand the local constraints observed in different contexts and to draw generic recommendations to improve health surveillance on a global scale. Acceptability of the strategies by all actors has been acknowledged as a key issue to ensure success of the actions along with the integration of private networks and actors within the surveillance system. This work helped in raising awareness among researchers, public decision-makers and private actors on evaluation issues, moving away from it being perceived as a control (audit) action often carried out by experts external to the issues and with limited benefits in return. In this regard, integrated evaluation, taking into consideration technical but also socio-economic issues in surveillance, should be promoted. This way, evaluation could be used as a programming tool, and in a participatory way to codevelop solutions with field actors to better inform decision-making in both animal and one health surveillance strategies. {\copyright} Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

  abstract = {Information about infectious diseases at the global level relies on effective, efficient and sustainable national and international surveillance systems. Surveillance systems need to be regularly evaluated to ensure their performance, the quality of the data and information provided, as well as to allocate resources efficiently. Currently available frameworks for evaluation of surveillance systems in animal or human health often treat technical, process and socio-economic aspects separately instead of integrating them. The surveillance evaluation (EVA) tool, a support tool for the evaluation of animal health surveillance systems, was developed to provide guidance for integrated evaluation of animal health surveillance including economic evaluation. The tool was developed by international experts in surveillance and evaluation in an iterative process of development, testing and revision taking into account existing frameworks and guidance, scientific literature and expert opinion. The EVA tool encompasses a web interface for users to develop an evaluation plan, a Wiki classroom to provide theoretical information on all required concepts and a generic evaluation work plan to facilitate implementation and reporting of outputs to decision makers. The tool was tested by planning and conducting epidemiological and economic evaluations of surveillance for classical and African swine fever, bovine virus diarrhoea, avian influenza, and Salmonella Dublin in five European countries. These practical applications highlighted the importance of a comprehensive evaluation approach to improve the quality of the evaluation outputs (economic evaluation; multiple attributes assessment) and demonstrated the usefulness of the guidance provided by the EVA tool. At the same time they showed that comprehensive evaluations might be constrained by practical issues (e.g. confidentiality concerns, data availability) and resource scarcity. In the long term, the EVA tool is expected to increase professional evaluation capacity and help optimising animal health surveillance system efficiency and resource allocation for both public and private actors of the surveillance systems.

  abstract = {Background: Nosocomial infection (NI) or cross-infection is a major health problem in hospitals worldwide. Aim(s): This study aimed to report the status of NIs and to evaluate the Iranian nosocomial infection surveillance system (INISS) in a teaching hospital in the south of Iran. Method(s): This is a comparative historical study on the records of hospital admitted patients from 2018 to 2019. Data on patients who were diagnosed with NI was extracted from the INISS database. The database includes data on the incidence of different types of NIs in each hospital ward, the patient's infection outcome, the agents involved, and the site of infection. Result(s): The results indicated that the rate of NI (cases of NI/ 100 admissions) in the hospital was \%2.95. The highest rate of NIs was reported from ICUs. Of the infected patients, 45.61\% were female, 98.95\% had underlying diseases, and 30.88\% died due to nosocomial infections. The median (IQR) of the duration of hospital stay among infected patients was 13 (7-18). The most common site of infection was VAE (ventilator-associated events) (39.40\%) and the most common isolated agent, irrespective of the organ involved, was Acinetobacter (spp.) (22.75\%). Conclusion(s): We reported ICU and Acinetobacter (spp.) as the most affected ward and most common agent involved in recorded NIs respectively. The rate of NI in the study hospital was exceptionally low when compared to its counterparts in a few other developed countries. The INISS needs to be further evaluated with regard to the completeness and representativeness of the surveillance system. Also, we need to evaluate the adherence to the INISS guidelines among staff and physicians in reporting the NIs.Copyright {\copyright} 2021, The Author(s).},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Despite a realistic strategy and availability of resources, multiple challenges still overwhelm countries grappling with the challenges of communicable disease surveillance. The Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy is by far the most pragmatic strategy in resource-poor settings. The objective of this study was to systematically review and document the lessons learned and the challenges identified with the implementation of the IDSR in low- and middle-income countries and to identify the main barriers that contribute to its sub-optimal functioning., METHODS: A systematic review of literature published in English using Web of Knowledge, PubMed, and databases of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) between 1998 and 2012 was undertaken. Additionally, manual reference and grey literature searches were conducted. Citations describing core and support functions or the quality attributes of the IDSR as described by WHO and CDC were included in the review., RESULTS: Thirty-three assessment studies met the inclusion criteria. IDSR strategy has been best adopted and implemented in the WHO-AFRO region. Although significant progress is made in overcoming the challenges identified with vertical disease surveillance strategies, gaps still exist. Mixed challenges with core and support IDSR functions were observed across countries. Main issues identified include non-sustainable financial resources, lack of co-ordination, inadequate training and turnover of peripheral staff, erratic feedback, inadequate supervision from the next level, weak laboratory capacities coupled with unavailability of job aids (case definitions/reporting formats), and poor availability of communication and transport systems particularly at the periphery. Best outcomes in core functions and system attributes were reported when support surveillance functions performed optimally. Apart from technical and technological issues, human resources and the health care system structures that receive the IDSR determine its output., CONCLUSIONS: The challenges identified with IDSR implementation are largely 'systemic'. IDSR will best benefit from skill-based training of personnel and strengthening of the support surveillance functions alongside health care infrastructures at the district level.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There has been a resurgence of tuberculosis worldwide, mainly in developing countries but also affecting the United Kingdom (UK), and other Western countries. The control of tuberculosis is dependent on early identification of cases and timely notification to public health departments to ensure appropriate treatment of cases and screening of contacts. Tuberculosis is compulsorily notifiable in the UK, and the doctor making or suspecting the diagnosis is legally responsible for notification. There is evidence of under-reporting of tuberculosis. This has implications for the control of tuberculosis as a disproportionate number of people who become infected are the most vulnerable in society, and are less likely to be identified and notified to the public health system. These include the poor, the homeless, refugees and ethnic minorities., METHOD: This study was a critical literature review on completeness of tuberculosis notification within the UK National Health Service (NHS) context. The review also identified data sources associated with reporting completeness and assessed whether studies corrected for undercount using capture-recapture (CR) methodology. Studies were included if they assessed completeness of tuberculosis notification quantitatively. The outcome measure used was notification completeness expressed between 0\% and 100\% of a defined denominator, or in numbers not notified where the denominator was unknown., RESULTS: Seven studies that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were identified through electronic and manual search of published and unpublished literature. One study used CR methodology. Analysis of the seven studies showed that undernotification varied from 7\% to 27\% in studies that had a denominator; and 38\%-49\% extra cases were identified in studies which examined specific data sources like pathology reports or prescriptions for anti-tuberculosis drugs. Cases notified were more likely to have positive microbiology than cases not notified which were more likely to have positive histopathology or be surgical in-patients. Collation of prescription data of two or more anti-tuberculosis drugs increases case ascertainment of tuberculosis., CONCLUSION: The reporting of tuberculosis is incomplete in the UK, although notification is a statutory requirement. Undernotification leads to an underestimation of the disease burden and hinders implementation of appropriate prevention and control strategies. The notification system needs to be strengthened to include education and training of all sub-specialities involved in diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis.},

  abstract = {Infection with the classical swine fever virus (CSFV) causes a disease in pigs that ranges from a hyperacute form in which animals die in a few hours to subclinical disease. Due to this wide range of virulence, several complementary surveillance strategies should be implemented for the early detection of the disease. The objective of the present study was to determine the sensitivity of the surveillance system to detect CSFV outbreaks in a free zone (Zone 1) and in a zone undergoing an eradication process (Zone 2) in Colombia. Stochastic scenario tree models were used to describe the population and surveillance structures and to determine the probability of CSFV detection. The total sensitivity of the surveillance system in the case of a single infected farm in Zone 1 was 31.4\% (CI 95\%: 7.2-54.1) and in the case of 5 infected farms was 85.2\% (CI 95\%: 67.3-93.7), while in Zone 2 the sensitivities were 27.8\% (CI 95\%: 6.4-55.1) and 82.5\% (CI 95\%: 65-92.9), respectively. The on-farm passive surveillance shows the highest sensitivity for detection of a single CSFV infected farm in both zones (22.8\% in Zone 1 and 22.5\% in Zone 2). The probability of detection was higher in a family / backyard premise than on a commercial farm in both zones. The passive surveillance at slaughterhouse had a sensitivity of 5.3\% and 4.5\% for the detection of a single infected farm in Zone 1 and 2, respectively. Active surveillance presented a range of sensitivity between 2.2\% and 4.5\%. In conclusion, the sensitivity of the surveillance in the two studied zones was quite high, one of reasons for this good sensitivity being the sentinel network based on the voluntary participation of 5,500 collaborators that were trained for the identification and notification of diseases of national interest.Copyright {\copyright} 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.},

At least one person (range 1 - 4) was interviewed at 47/54 health facilities (87.0\%), 11/13 subdistrict and district TB offices (84.6\%), 2/3 provincial TB offices (66.7\%), and at the national level (1/1, 100.0\%). Of 119 TB staff, 64.7\% recognised the purpose of TB surveillance as guiding programme planning, implementation and evaluation. However, only 16.0\% reported using data to measure disease burden, 8.4\% to monitor trends, and 9.2\% to inform resource allocation. The majority reported using TB management tools provided by the national programme, but 44.5\% also described using additional tools. Personnel mentioned the need for dedicated surveillance staff, training on recording and reporting, improved computer access, and methods to apply information from surveillance data to the programme. Conclusions. The majority of TB staff understood the purpose of surveillance but did not routinely use data to guide programme planning, implementation and evaluation. Training and supporting TB staff to utilise surveillance data will help improve the TB surveillance system.Copyright {\copyright} 2016, South African Medical Association. All rights reserved.},

The main objective of AFP surveillance is to detect circulating wild polio virus and provide data for developing effective prevention and control strategies as well planning and decision making. Bikita district failed to detect a case for the past two years., FINDINGS: A total of 31 health workers from 14 health centres were interviewed. Health worker knowledge on AFP was low in Bikita. The system was acceptable, flexible, and representative but not stable and not sensitive since it missed1 AFP case. The system was not useful to the district since data collected was not locally used in anyway. The cost of running the system was high. The district had no adequate resources to run the system. Reasons for not reporting cases was that the mothers were not bringing children with AFP and ignorance of health workers on syndromes captured under AFP., CONCLUSION: Health worker's knowledge on AFP was low and all interviewed workers needed training surveillance. The system was found to be flexible but unacceptable. Reasons for failure to detect AFP cases could be, no cases reporting to the centres, lack of knowledge on health workers hence failure to recognise symptoms, high staff turnover.}

Around 17\% of the directors never read the reports and others reported not finding the information contained in them useful. While we found the information generated from the surveillance system has an important role in triggering action for epidemics and pervades more general decision making by improving the general knowledge of sexually transmitted infection trends, the indicators are not seen as useful by most key stakeholders., CONCLUSIONS: Significant improvements in the utility of the system could be made by changes to the data output and key suggestions made by the stakeholders are outlined.},

The objective of this study was to evaluate the capacity of the syndromic surveillance system using OSCOUR{\textregistered} data at a regional level to reliably and robustly produce a reactive estimate of the health impact related to weather alerts in Occitanie. Medical records of the 66 emergency departments in the Occitanie region were collected daily from 2 June to 8 September 2017. They were used to assess the completeness of attendances containing a valid diagnosis code (filling rate), the reactivity (from D+1 to D+8 of the date of attendance), and the stability of transmissions to OSCOUR{\textregistered} network focusing on heat related illnesses. Transmission and completeness criteria were also proposed to rank Occitanie departments according to their ability to provide complete and responsive information. The results show that the use of syndromic indicators the day after a heatwave alert would lead, at the regional level, to an underestimate of 35 to 40\% of the estimate of the health impact of this event (number of attendances and hospitalizations for heat-related diseases), and the data consolidation delay is approximately 2 to 3 days. Nevertheless, disparities exist between the Occitanie departments and for 5 of them, an estimate of the health impact related to a heatwave can be considered as reliable the day after its start. On the other hand, monitoring the proportion of attendances for heat-related illness among all the attendances with an informed diagnosis is a reliable and robust indicator the day after the heatwave start for the entire region. This study provides useful elements for the interpretation of syndromic surveillance data in real time and provides suggestions for improving data quality as part of the work to be followed in connection with FedORU (Federation of Emergency Departments Observatories).},

Some WBD are notifiable in most countries surveyed, others are notifiable only in one country. Non-notifiable WBD are routinely monitored in five countries. Surveillance schemes are inconsistent, and the variable mandatory reporting among the Member States allows many WBD cases to remain unidentified. Nine replying countries had no legal definition for WBD outbreak. No country requires the reporting of anti-diarrhea medication sales for detecting outbreaks.}

Rajasthan reported cases during 2018-2019 in state reporting system but did not report any case to central Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) unit. We evaluated the Scrub typhus surveillance system in Alwar district, Rajasthan, with the objective of describing and evaluating the system and providing evidence-based recommendations to identify gaps., Material and Methods: In cross-sectional study, we reviewed records and conducted key informant interviews at district- and block-level health facilities. Using US Centers for Disease Control guidelines, we evaluated the system by framing indicators for selected attributes for a defined reference period. Overall performance was ranked as outstanding (90-100\%), excellent (80-89\%), very good (70-79\%), good (60-69\%), and poor ({$<$}60\%)., Results: Line list of confirmed cases was sent from district to block level for additional active case search (ACS) to implement control measures. We conducted 26 key informant interviews and reviewed records and calculated simplicity as 79\%, flexibility 100\%, data quality 46\%, acceptability 92\%, representativeness 48\%, timeliness 43\%, and stability 79\%., Conclusions: Epidemiological surveillance (active and passive) is a core intervention under scrub typhus surveillance system. Lab reports were incompletely uploaded on IDSP portal. Surveillance reports should be updated after each ACS. Reporting format under IDSP should be uploaded timely, and lab reports from state should be sent within 48 hours of diagnosis so that case investigation is not delayed.

Material \& Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted in January 2015 at DR-TB Centre of NITRD, New Delhi which caters to a population of 29 lacs. PMDT surveillance system was evaluated using attributes like simplicity, data quality, acceptability, positive predictive value, representativeness and timeliness defined by CDC, USA guidelines. Relevant information was collected using data abstraction form and interview with stakeholders. Data was analysed using EpiInfo 07 version. Results: Nodal officer and District TB officer are responsible for surveillance system activities of PMDT at DR-TB centre and district level, respectively. All the reports (100\%) were submitted on time and all the districts were reporting to DR-TB centre. 75\% of TB-HIV coordinators found reporting formats to be simple but all the quarterly reports were found to be complete. Data quality was not found to be optimal. Conclusion: Private sector needs to be taken on board as they have no to minimal involvement in PMDT. For data quality improvement time to time training of medical officers and health workers should be organized.},

We describe a systematic review summarizing economic analyses of genomic surveillance of bacterial pathogens, reviewing the evidence for economic viability. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021289030). Six databases were searched on 8 November 2021 using terms related to 'WGS', 'population surveillance' and 'economic analysis'. Quality was assessed with the Drummond-Jefferson checklist. Following data extraction, a narrative synthesis approach was taken. Six hundred and eighty-one articles were identified, of which 49 proceeded to full-text screening, with 9 selected for inclusion. All had been published since 2019. Heterogeneity was high. Five studies assessed WGS for hospital surveillance and four analysed foodborne pathogens. Four were cost-benefit analyses, one was a cost-utility analysis, one was a cost-effectiveness analysis, one was a combined cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis, one combined cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analyses and one was a partial analysis. All studies supported the use of WGS as a surveillance tool on economic grounds. The available evidence supports the use of WGS for pathogen surveillance but is limited by marked heterogeneity. Further work should include analysis relevant to low- and middle-income countries and should use real-world effectiveness data.},

This paper summarizes PERRC studies that addressed the development and assessment of criteria for evaluating PHEPR and metrics for measuring their efficiency and effectiveness.Methods We reviewed 171 PERRC publications indexed in PubMed between 2009 and 2016. These publications derived from 34 PERRC research projects. We identified publications that addressed the development or assessment of criteria and metrics pertaining to PHEPR systems and describe the evaluation methods used and tools developed, the system domains evaluated, and the metrics developed or assessed.Results We identified 29 publications from 12 of the 34 PERRC projects that addressed PHEPR system evaluation criteria and metrics. We grouped each study into 1 of 3 system domains, based on the metrics developed or assessed: (1) organizational characteristics (n = 9), (2) emergency response performance (n = 12), and (3) workforce capacity or capability (n = 8). These studies addressed PHEPR system activities including responses to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and the 2011 tsunami, as well as emergency exercise performance, situational awareness, and workforce willingness to respond. Both PHEPR system process and outcome metrics were developed or assessed by PERRC studies.Conclusions PERRC researchers developed and evaluated a range of PHEPR system evaluation criteria and metrics that should be considered by system partners interested in assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of their activities. Nonetheless, the monitoring and measurement problem in PHEPR is far from solved. Lack of standard measures that are readily obtained or computed at local levels remains a challenge for the public health preparedness field.},

Resistant organisms exist in humans, animals, food and the environment, and the main driver of this resistance is antimicrobial usage. A One Health conceptual framework for surveillance is presented to include all of these aspects. Global and European (regional and national) surveillance systems are described, highlighting shortcomings compared with the framework. Policy decisions rely on economic and scientific evidence, so the business case for a fully integrated system is presented. The costs of integrated surveillance are offset by the costs of unchecked resistance and the benefits arising from interventions and outcomes. Current estimates focus on costs and benefits of human health outcomes. A One Health assessment includes wider societal costs of lost labour, changes in health-seeking behaviour, impacts on animal health and welfare, higher costs of animal-origin food production, and reduced consumer confidence in safety and international trade of such food. Benefits of surveillance may take years to realise and are dependent on effective and accepted interventions. Benefits, including the less tangible, such as improved synergies and efficiencies in service delivery and more timely and accurate risk identification, should also be recognised. By including these less tangible benefits to society, animal welfare, ecosystem health and resilience, together with the savings and efficiencies through shared resources and social capital-building, a stronger business case for a One Health approach to surveillance can be made.},

  abstract = {The "R{\'e}sabeille" pilot epidemiological surveillance program is the French component of the European Epilobee surveillance system. It was implemented during two consecutive seasons (2012-2013 and 2013-2014) in six areas (French "d{\'e}partements") in the country. The objectives of this active surveillance system were to estimate the winter and in-season mortality as well as the prevalence of certain infectious and parasitic diseases of honey bees. Our study was specifically designed to evaluate quantitatively the quality of the data collected under the French surveillance program and to identify the difficulties experienced in the collection and compilation of data. Several dimensions of data quality (completeness, format, plausibility and consistency) were analyzed quantitatively. Furthermore, in order to assess the quality of entries into the visit forms and the quality of their recording into the database, 60 Spring 2014 visits forms were thoroughly analyzed and double entered into the database. In the evaluation of winter mortality data, plausibility varied between 98 and 100[\%] depending on the variable considered and the consistency was 82[\%]. In a random sample of 60 visit forms, between 77 and 97[\%] of the expected data were recorded. The recording was feasible for all the items to be filled in the visit form, but between 12 and 27[\%] of the data required an interpretation prior to the recoding (such as finding the correct value by crossing with other data in the visit form). Comparing the entry of data into the forms made by actors in the field with our double entry, led us to estimate that between 36 and 73[\%] of the data in the visit forms were improperly recorded at the time of data entry (mostly in cases where the estimation of the correct value required crossing with other information from the visit form), which led to misinterpretation. Between 0 and 2[\%] of data properly entered into the visit forms were incorrectly entered into the compilation. The results of this investigation led us to propose various improvements for future campaigns, in the design of the visit forms, in the training of actors, in coordination and assistance and in data verification prior to entry into the database.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Past and present national initiatives advocate for electronic exchange of health data and emphasize interoperability. The critical role of public health in the context of disease surveillance was recognized with recommendations for electronic laboratory reporting (ELR). Many public health agencies have seen a trend towards centralization of information technology services which adds another layer of complexity to interoperability efforts., OBJECTIVES: The study objective was to understand the process of data exchange and its impact on the quality of data being transmitted in the context of electronic laboratory reporting to public health. This was conducted in context of Minnesota Electronic Disease Surveillance System (MEDSS), the public health information system for supporting infectious disease surveillance in Minnesota. Data Quality (DQ) dimensions by Strong et al., was chosen as the guiding framework for evaluation., METHODS: The process of assessing data exchange for electronic lab reporting and its impact was a mixed methods approach with qualitative data obtained through expert discussions and quantitative data obtained from queries of the MEDSS system. Interviews were conducted in an open-ended format from November 2017 through February 2018. Based on these discussions, two high level categories of data exchange process which could impact data quality were identified: onboarding for electronic lab reporting and internal data exchange routing. This in turn comprised of ten critical steps and its impact on quality of data was identified through expert input. This was followed by analysis of data in MEDSS by various criteria identified by the informatics team., RESULTS: All DQ metrics (Intrinsic DQ, Contextual DQ, Representational DQ, and Accessibility DQ) were impacted in the data exchange process with varying influence on DQ dimensions. Some errors such as improper mapping in electronic health records (EHRs) and laboratory information systems had a cascading effect and can pass through technical filters and go undetected till use of data by epidemiologists. Some DQ dimensions such as accuracy, relevancy, value-added data and interpretability are more dependent on users at either end of the data exchange spectrum, the relevant clinical groups and the public health program professionals. The study revealed that data quality is dynamic and on-going oversight is a combined effort by MEDSS Informatics team and review by technical and public health program professionals., CONCLUSION: With increasing electronic reporting to public health, there is a need to understand the current processes for electronic exchange and their impact on quality of data. This study focused on electronic laboratory reporting to public health and analyzed both onboarding and internal data exchange processes. Insights gathered from this research can be applied to other public health reporting currently (e.g. immunizations) and will be valuable in planning for electronic case reporting in near future.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nigeria, the last endemic country in the WHO African Region, was certified free of Wild Polio Virus (WPV) in 2020. However, due to low immunity in some communities in Sokoto, outbreaks of the circulating Vaccine Derived Polio Virus (cVDPV) occur. The aim of this study is to evaluate the Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) surveillance indicators in Sokoto state, Nigeria., METHODS: This retrospective study was an analysis of routinely collected AFP surveillance data between 2012 and 2019 by the Sokoto state surveillance network. We assessed the Sokoto state AFP surveillance system using the AFP surveillance performance indicators. We performed all analyses using Microsoft Excel 2019., RESULTS: Cumulatively, 3001 Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) cases were reported over the evaluation period, out of which 1692 (56.4\%) were males, and 2478 (82.4\%) were below five years. More than half, 1773 (59.1\%), had a fever at the beginning of the disease, and 1911 (63.7\%) had asymmetric paralysis. The non-polio AFP rate (9.1 to 23.5\% per 100,000 children {$<$} 15 years old) and stool adequacy rate (92.5 to 100\%) indicate high sensitivity. The proportion of cases that had stool samples collected early, timely transported to the laboratory and arrived at the laboratory in optimal condition were all above the World Health Organization (WHO) minimum standard of 80\%. There was inadequate profile documentation of some suspected cases., CONCLUSIONS: Sokoto State has exceeded the WHO minimum standards in most of the AFP surveillance indicators. The performance of the system is sufficient enough to detect any reintroduction of WPV into the state. However, there is a need for improvement in data quality.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In parts of the developing world traditionally modeled healthcare systems do not adequately meet the needs of the populace. This can be due to imbalances in both supply and demand--there may be a lack of sufficient healthcare and the population most at need may be unable or unwilling to take advantage of it. Home-based care has emerged as a possible mechanism to bring healthcare to the populace in a cost-effective, useful manner. This study describes the development, implementation, and evaluation of a mobile device-based system to support such services., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mobile phones were utilized and a structured survey was implemented to be administered by community health workers using Open Data Kit. This system was used to support screening efforts for a population of two million persons in western Kenya., RESULTS: Users of the system felt it was easy to use and facilitated their work. The system was also more cost effective than pen and paper alternatives., DISCUSSION: This implementation is one of the largest applications of a system utilizing handheld devices for performing clinical care during home visits in a resource-constrained environment. Because the data were immediately available electronically, initial reports could be performed and important trends in data could thus be detected. This allowed adjustments to the programme to be made sooner than might have otherwise been possible., CONCLUSION: A viable, cost-effective solution at scale has been developed and implemented for collecting electronic data during household visits in a resource-constrained setting.},

  abstract = {PROBLEM: Evaluation of influenza surveillance systems is poor, especially in Africa., APPROACH: In 2007, the Institut Pasteur de Madagascar and the Malagasy Ministry of Public Health implemented a countrywide system for the prospective syndromic and virological surveillance of influenza-like illnesses. In assessing this system's performance, we identified gaps and ways to promote the best use of resources. We investigated acceptability, data quality, flexibility, representativeness, simplicity, stability, timeliness and usefulness and developed qualitative and/or quantitative indicators for each of these attributes., LOCAL SETTING: Until 2007, the influenza surveillance system in Madagascar was only operational in Antananarivo and the observations made could not be extrapolated to the entire country., RELEVANT CHANGES: By 2014, the system covered 34 sentinel sites across the country. At 12 sites, nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal samples were collected and tested for influenza virus. Between 2009 and 2014, 177 718 fever cases were detected, 25 809 (14.5\%) of these fever cases were classified as cases of influenza-like illness. Of the 9192 samples from patients with influenza-like illness that were tested for influenza viruses, 3573 (38.9\%) tested positive. Data quality for all evaluated indicators was categorized as above 90\% and the system also appeared to be strong in terms of its acceptability, simplicity and stability. However, sample collection needed improvement., LESSONS LEARNT: The influenza surveillance system in Madagascar performed well and provided reliable and timely data for public health interventions. Given its flexibility and overall moderate cost, this system may become a useful platform for syndromic and laboratory-based surveillance in other low-resource settings.},

The percentage of incompleteness was based on the blank/unknown responses in the DCs per regional health office and the proportional variation rate of incompleteness between the two periods. It was observed that the filling out of information did not show a well-defined pattern per office, with a reduction in incompleteness occurring for most variables, though the sex, age and place of occurrence of death variables alone revealed {$\leq$}5\% incompleteness in the second term of study, which was considered excellent in terms of the Romero and Cunha scores. Despite the decrease in incompleteness related to pregnancy, childbirth and mother-related variables, in the second triennium incompleteness between 10 and 20\% was observed, with a regular score in the 2009-2011 triennium. Despite the improvement in the filling out of details in the State, it is necessary to strengthen surveillance and training for completing the DCs by the Committees for Prevention of Infant Mortality.},

Information was collected by Healthcare structures (HS) on paper forms and transferred to the central level by post or email. Completeness of data reporting was around 20\% in 2009-10. From 2011, in two southern regions data were transmitted through short messages service using one telephone provider. We evaluated the system in 2014-15 to determine its performance before changing or expanding it., METHODS: We randomly selected 80 HS and interviewed their representatives face-to-face (42) or by telephone (38). We evaluated knowledge of surveillance activities and selected case definitions, number of SMS with erroneous or missing information among the last ten transferred SMS, proportion of weekly reports received in the last 4 weeks and of the last four health alerts notified within 48 h, as well as mobile phone network coverage., RESULTS: Sixty-four percent of 80 interviewed HS representatives didn't know their terms of reference, 83\% were familiar with the malaria case definition and 32\% with that of dengue. Ninety percent (37/41) of visited HS had five or more errors and 47\% had missing data in the last ten SMS they transferred. The average time needed for weekly IDSR data compilation was 24 min in the Southern and 47 in the South-eastern region. Of 320 expected SMS 232 (73\%) were received, 136 (43\%) of them in time. Out of 38 alerts detected, four were notified on time. Nine percent (7/80) of HS had no telephone network with the current provider., CONCLUSIONS: SMS transfer has improved IDSR data completeness, but timeliness and data quality remain a problem. Healthcare staff needs training on guidelines and case definitions. From 2016, data are collected and managed electronically to reduce errors and improve the system's performance.},

These symptoms are found in patients with AFP (Acute Flaccid Paralysis). AFP surveillance is an observation made of all cases of acute paralysis or AFP in children aged {$<$}15 years who are vulnerable to polio. The priority problem that is still found in the East Java Provincial Health Office regarding AFP surveillance is the reduction in the discovery of non-polio AFP cases and adequate specimens. Aim(s): The purpose of this study was to analyze the implementation of AFP surveillance activities in the East Java Province Health Office in 2019. Method(s): Data collection was carried out by primary and secondary to study the AFP surveillance overview. Primary data were obtained from in depth interviews with AFP surveillance program holders in East Java Provincial Health Office. Secondary data is processed using Microsoft Office Excel, Epi Info and Quantum GIS. Result(s): The result is in 2019 the rate of non-polio AFP and the percentage of adequate specimens in East Java Province has under the target. In 2019 there was a decrease compared to the previous year, the non-polio AFP rate was 1.64 and the percentage of adequate specimens was 56.2\%. Only as many as six districts / cities in East Java Province had pass these two indicators. Conclusion(s): The lack of visits and reports from both the hospital and the community is one of causative factor. Intensive and routine AFP surveillance is needed to monitor the emergence of polio cases.Copyright {\copyright} 2021, Institute of Medico-Legal Publications. All rights reserved.},

Distribute is a distributed community-based syndromic surveillance system and network for detection of influenza-like illness (ILI). Using qualitative methods, we assessed the perceived usefulness of the Distribute system and explored areas for improvement. Nine state and local public health professionals participated in a focus group (n = 6) and in semi-structured interviews (n = 3). Field notes were taken, summarized and analyzed., FINDINGS: Several emergent themes that contribute to the perceived usefulness of system data and the Distribute system were identified: 1) Standardization: a common ILI syndrome definition; 2) Regional Comparability: views that support county-by-county comparisons of syndromic surveillance data; 3) Completeness: complete data for all expected data at a given time; 4) Coverage: data coverage of all jurisdictions in WA state; 5) CONTEXT: metadata incorporated into the views to provide context for graphed data; 6) Trusted Data: verification that information is valid and timely; and 7) Customization: the ability to customize views as necessary. As a result of the focus group, a new county level health jurisdiction expressed interest in contributing data to the Distribute system., CONCLUSION: The resulting themes from this study can be used to guide future information design efforts for the Distribute system and other syndromic surveillance systems. In addition, this study demonstrates the benefits of conducting a low cost, qualitative evaluation at a professional conference.}

We evaluated IMS acceptability and to which extent participants represented the Swedish population. We also studied the agreement of data on influenza-like illness (ILI) occurrence from IMS with data from a previously evaluated population-based system (PBS) with an actively recruited random sample of the population who spontaneously report disease onsets in real-time via telephone/Internet, and with traditional general practitioner based sentinel and virological influenza surveillance, in the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 influenza seasons. We assessed acceptability by calculating the participation proportion in an invited IMS-sample and the weekly reporting proportion of enrolled self-recruited IMS participants. We compared distributions of socio-demographic indicators of self-recruited IMS participants to the general Swedish population using chi-square tests. Finally, we assessed the agreement of weekly incidence proportions (\%) of ILI in IMS and PBS with cross-correlation analyses. Among 2,511 invited persons, 166 (6.6\%) agreed to participate in the IMS. In each season, 2,552 and 2,486 self-recruited persons participated in the IMS respectively. The weekly reporting proportion among self-recruited participants decreased from 87\% to 23\% (2011-2012) and 82\% to 45\% (2012-2013). Women, highly educated, and middle-aged persons were overrepresented among self-recruited IMS participants (p{$<$}0.01). IMS (invited and self-recruited) and PBS weekly incidence proportions correlated strongest when no lags were applied (r = 0.71 and r = 0.69, p{$<$}0.05). This evaluation revealed socio-demographic misrepresentation and limited compliance among the self-recruited IMS participants. Yet, IMS offered a reasonable representation of the temporal ILI pattern in the community overall during the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 influenza seasons and could be a simple tool for collecting community-based ILI data.}

Considerable variation exists in the structure and performance of surveillance systems for communicable disease prevention and control. European Union (EU) countries should share ideas to improve the quality of surveillance systems. The study aims to support the improvement and integration of surveillance systems of communicable diseases in Europe while using benchmarking for the comparison of national surveillance systems., METHODS: Surveillance systems from England and Wales, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, and The Netherlands were described and analysed. After comprehensive data collection and validation by several European public health (PH) experts, a descriptive data analysis was carried out. Benchmarking processes were performed with selected criteria (e.g. case definitions, early warning applications, and outbreak investigations). After the description of benchmarks, best practices were identified and described., RESULTS: Benchmarking of national surveillance systems is applicable as a new tool for the comparison of communicable disease control in Europe. The countries included in the study have in general well-functioning communicable disease control and prevention systems. Nevertheless, there are different strengths and weaknesses in various countries. Practical examples from the various surveillance systems were demonstrated and recommendations were given to policy makers., CONCLUSION: A gold standard of surveillance systems in various European countries is very difficult to achieve because of heterogeneity (e.g. in disease burden, personal, and financial resources). However, to improve the quality of surveillance systems across Europe, it will be useful to benchmark the surveillance systems of all EU member states.},

Epidemiologists obtained the Washington County subset of the Oregon Violent Death Reporting System (OR-VDRS). To determine if additional information beyond the OR-VDRS was available through a standard death investigation, an epidemiologist shadowed medicolegal death investigators (MDIs) for nearly 2 years. The MDIs and epidemiologist developed a novel, real-time, MDI-entered surveillance system, the Suicide Risk Factor Surveillance System (SRFSS), to capture suicide risk factor data with greater timeliness and accuracy than available through the OR-VDRS. To evaluate the performance of each surveillance system, differences in the prevalence of suicide risk factor data from SRFSS were compared with the county OR-VDRS subset for the same 133 suicides occurring in 2014-2015. Across 27 suicide risk factors and circumstances, the median difference in prevalence was 10.5 percentage points between the OR-VDRS and the SRFSS, with the higher prevalence in SRFSS. The prevalence was significantly different between the 2 surveillance systems for 21 (78\%) of 27 variables. This study demonstrates the truly exceptional data quality and timeliness of MDI information over traditional sources.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) have complex patients in terms of their diagnoses and required treatments. Antimicrobial treatment is a common therapy for patients in NICUs. To solve problems pertaining to empirical therapy, antimicrobial stewardship programs have recently been introduced. Despite the success of these programs in terms of data collection, there is still inefficiency in terms of analyzing and reporting the data. Thus, to successfully implement these stewardship programs, the design of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance systems is recommended as a first step. As a result, this study aimed to design an AMR surveillance system for use in the NICUs in northwestern Iranian hospitals to cover these information gaps. Method(s): The recommended system is compatible with the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. The business intelligence (BI) requirements were extracted in an interview with a product owner (PO) using a valid and reliable checklist. Following this, an AMR surveillance system was designed and evaluated in relation to user experiences via a user experience questionnaire (UEQ). Finally, an association analysis was performed on the database, and the results were reported by identifying the important multidrug resistances in the database. Result(s): A customized software development methodology was proposed. The three major modules of the AMR surveillance are the data registry, dashboard, and decision support modules. The data registry module was implemented based on a three-tier architecture, and the Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) and dashboard modules were designed based on the BI requirements of the Scrum product owner (PO). The mean values of UEQ measures were in a good range. This measures showed the suitable usability of the AMR surveillance system. Conclusion(s): Applying efficient software development methodologies allows for the systems' compatibility with users' opinions and requirements. In addition, the construction of interdisciplinary communication models for research and software engineering allows for research and development concepts to be used in operational environments.Copyright {\copyright} 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Collaborative approaches in health, such as One Health (OH), are promising; nevertheless, several authors point at persistent challenges for designing and implementing OH initiatives. Among other challenges, OH practitioners struggle in their efforts to collaborate across disciplines and domains. This paper aims to provide insights into the existing challenges for designing and implementing OH initiatives, their causes and solutions, and points out strategic solutions with the potential to solve practical challenges. A systematic literature search was performed for emerging challenges and proposed solutions in the process of conducting OH initiatives. Next, a thematic and a causal analysis were performed to unravel challenges and their causes. Finally, solutions were discriminated on whether they were only recommended, or implemented as a proof-of-principle. The 56 included papers describe 21 challenges endured by OH initiatives that relate to different themes (policy and funding; education and training; surveillance; multi-actor, multi-domain, and multi-level collaborations; and evidence). These challenges occur in three different phases: the acquisition of sufficient conditions to start an initiative, its execution, and its monitoring and evaluation. The findings indicate that individual challenges share overlapping causes and crosscutting causal relations. Accordingly, solutions for the successful performance of OH initiatives should be implemented to tackle simultaneously different types of challenges occurring in different phases. Still, promoting collaboration between the wide diversity of stakeholders, as a fundamental aspect in the OH approach, is still by far the most challenging factor in performing OH initiatives. Causes for that are the difficulties in promoting meaningful and equal participation from diverse actors. Solutions proposed for this challenge focused on guiding stakeholders to think and collaborate beyond their professional and cultural silos to generate knowledge co-creation and innovative methodologies and frameworks. Finally, the biggest knowledge gap identified, in terms of proposed solutions, was for monitoring and evaluating OH initiatives. This highlights the need for future research on evaluation methods and tools specific for the OH approach, to provide credible evidence on its added value. When considering challenges endured by former OH initiatives and the proposed solutions for these challenges, practitioners should be able to plan and structure such initiatives in a more successful way, through the strategic pre-consideration of solutions or simply by avoiding known barriers.},

Concern about the spread of communicable diseases in shelters prompted the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to rapidly develop a surveillance system to report communicable diseases and emergency department transports from shelters. We describe the implementation of this system. Establishing effective surveillance in temporary shelters was challenging and required in-person visits by DOHMH staff to ensure reporting. After system establishment, surveillance data were used to identify some potential disease clusters. For the future, we recommend pre-event planning for disease surveillance.},

  abstract = {Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a common disease in cattle and wildlife, with health, zoonotic and economic implications. Infected wild animals, and particularly reservoirs, could hinder eradication of bTB from cattle populations, which could have an important impact on international cattle trade. Therefore, surveillance of bTB in wildlife is of particular importance to better understand the epidemiological role of wild species and to adapt the control measures. In France, a bTB surveillance system for free-ranging wildlife, the Sylvatub system, has been implemented since 2011. It relies on three surveillance components (SSCs) (passive surveillance on hunted animals (EC-SSC), passive surveillance on dead or dying animals (SAGIR-SSC) and active surveillance (PSURV-SSC)). The effectiveness of the Sylvatub system was previously assessed, through the estimation of its sensitivity (i.e. the probability of detecting at least one case of bTB infection by each SSC, specie and risk-level area). However, to globally assess the performance of a surveillance system, the measure of its sensitivity is not sufficient, as other factors such as economic or socio-economic factors could influence the effectiveness. We report here an estimation of the costs of the surveillance activities of the Sylvatub system, and of the cost-effectiveness of each surveillance component, by specie and risk-level, based on scenario tree modelling with the same tree structure as used for the sensitivity evaluation. The cost-effectiveness of the Sylvatub surveillance is better in higher-risk departments, due in particular to the higher probability of detecting the infection (sensitivity). Moreover, EC-SSC, which has the highest unit cost, is more efficient than the surveillance enhanced by the SAGIR-SSC, due to its better sensitivity. The calculation of the cost-effectiveness ratio shows that PSURV-SSC remains the most cost-effective surveillance component of the Sylvatub system, despite its high cost in terms of coordination, sample collection and laboratory analysis.},

  abstract = {Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a common disease of cattle and wildlife, with economic repercussions and implications for animal and human health. The surveillance of bTB in wildlife is particularly important, to shed light on the epidemiological role of wild species and for the adaptation of control measures. In France, a bTB surveillance system for free-ranging wildlife, the Sylvatub system, was launched in 2011 on wild boars, red deer, roe deer and badgers. It relies on active and passive surveillance activities, constrained by practical difficulties, such as the accessibility of wild animals, and regulatory rules for the trapping of badgers, for example. We report here the first assessment of stakeholders' perceptions of the Sylvatub system and its acceptability, based on 20 individual semi-structured interviews with three types of stakeholder (collectors, coordinators, officers) in areas with different rates of bTB infection. With the caveat that these findings cannot be assumed to be representative of the national situation, we found that the Sylvatub system was considered useful by all the stakeholders interviewed. Those from the world of hunting participate in surveillance mostly to help livestock farmers, who are not systematically involved in bTB surveillance in wildlife. Many practical and regulatory constraints were raised, which could be offset by recognition of the work done by the "hunting community", to maintain the willingness of these individuals to participate. We also identified a need for improvements in communication and information. Qualitative information, such as that collected here, is essential to improve our understanding of the reasons favoring and disfavoring participation in surveillance, and should be taken into account in the evaluation process. These results are relevant to hunters and to veterinary authorities wishing to identify the determinants of participation in the Sylvatub system. They could provide support for decision-making processes to improve surveillance strategies.Copyright: {\copyright} 2018 Riviere et al.

We present an overview of a mobile phone-based frontline surveillance system developed and implemented in Sri Lanka. Field veterinarians reported animal health information by using mobile phones. Submissions increased steadily over 9 months, with =4,000 interactions between field veterinarians and reports on the animal population received by the system. Development of human resources and increased communication between local stakeholders (groups and persons whose actions are affected by emerging infectious diseases and animal health) were instrumental for successful implementation. The primary lesson learned was that mobile phone-based surveillance of animal populations is acceptable and feasible in lower-resource settings. However, any system implementation plan must consider the time needed to garner support for novel surveillance methods among users and stakeholders.}

  abstract = {Background. Vector-borne diseases are a public health problem in Colombia, an area that has become hyperendemic for dengue virus. This situation has been aggravated by the introduction of other arboviruses such as chikungunya and Zika in the last 3 years. Mobile health (mHealth) offers new strategies for strengthening healthcare and surveillance systems. A large number of mHealth tools are available; however, very few have been evaluated regarding usability and acceptability. This study aimed to evaluate the usability and acceptability of a mobile application, FeverDX, as a support tool in the management of patients with febrile syndrome and suspected vector-borne infection by general practitioners from Colombia. Methods. The usability and acceptability of FeverDX were evaluated using the modified version of the Mobile Application Rating Scale (uMARS). The evaluation included aspects of content, user engagement, functionality, user-interface design, impact, and subjective quality. Results. Between December 2016 and January 2017, a total of 20 general practitioners evaluated FeverDX. Seventy-five percent of the evaluators reported being aware of the Colombian Ministry of Health guidelines for diagnosis and management of arboviruses. 80\% of evaluators partially or completely agreed the application information agreed with management guidelines. On uMARS scale, FeverDX excelled regarding impact (median = 5/5, IQR = 5-5); functionality (5/5, 4.8-5); and information and scientific basis (4/5, 4-4). FeverDX scored well regarding user feedback (median = 4/5, IQR = 4-4.5); design and esthetics (4/5, 4-4.3); and subjective assessment of quality (4.5/5, 4.3-4.8). Conclusion. Despite a large number of mHealth tools available, the literature lacks evaluated and evidence-based mobile technology. Applying Information and Communications Technologies in health areas can strengthen care processes and facilitate the detection and reporting of reportable surveillance diseases. Assess the usability and acceptability of mobile health applications increases the reliability of these technologies. The mobile app, FeverDx, can improve adherence to guidelines for management and prevention of prevalent diseases.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Syndromic surveillance consists of the systematic collection and use of near real-time data about health-related events for situational awareness and public health action. As syndromic surveillance programs continue to adopt new technologies and expand, it is valuable to evaluate these syndromic surveillance systems and practices to ensure that they meet public health needs., OBJECTIVE: This assessment's aim is to provide recent information about syndromic surveillance systems and practice characteristics among a group of state and local health departments., DESIGN/SETTING: Information was obtained between November 2017 and June 2018 through a telephone survey using an Office of Management and Budget-approved standardized data collection tool. Participants were syndromic surveillance staff from each of 31 state and local health departments participating in the National Syndromic Surveillance Program funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Questions included jurisdictional experience, data sources and analysis systems used, syndromic system data processing characteristics, data quality verification procedures, and surveillance activities conducted with syndromic data., MEASURES: Practice-specific information such as types of systems and data sources used for syndromic surveillance, data quality monitoring, and uses of data for public health situational awareness (eg, investigating occurrences of or trends in diseases)., RESULTS: The survey analysis revealed a wide range of experiences with syndromic surveillance. Participants reported the receipt of data daily or more frequently. Emergency department data were the primary data source; however, other data sources are being integrated into these systems. All health departments routinely monitored data quality. Syndromes of highest priority across the respondents for health events monitoring were influenza-like illness and drug-related syndromes. However, a wide variety of syndromes were reported as priorities across the health departments., CONCLUSION: Overall, syndromic surveillance was relevantly integrated into the public health surveillance infrastructure. The near real-time nature of the data and its flexibility to monitor different types of health-related issues make it especially useful for public health practitioners. Despite these advances, syndromic surveillance capacity, locally and nationally, must continue to evolve and progress should be monitored to ensure that syndromic surveillance systems and data are optimally able to meet jurisdictional needs.

To strengthen outbreak identification, health authorities piloted a mobile phone-based syndromic surveillance system and used established frameworks to evaluate whether the system was meeting objectives. Stakeholder experience was investigated by using standardized questionnaires and focus groups. Nine sites reported data that included 7 outbreaks and 92 cases of acute watery diarrhea. The new system was more timely (2.4 vs. 84 days), complete (70\% vs. 40\%), and sensitive (95\% vs. 26\%) than existing systems. The system was simple, stable, useful, and acceptable; however, feedback and subnational involvement were weak. A simple syndromic surveillance system implemented in a fragile state enabled more timely, complete, and sensitive data reporting for disease risk assessment. Feedback and provincial involvement require improvement. Use of mobile phone technology might improve the timeliness and efficiency of public health surveillance.}

Former experiences demonstrated that emergency department (ED) surveillance can help characterise the burden of outpatient ADEs. We developed a clinical pharmacy programme called the clinical pharmacy survey of adverse drug events (CPSA) to support interventions and research projects in the area of ADE prevention and management., OBJECTIVE: To design a survey to identify and describe ADEs in patients visiting the medical ED of our tertiary care hospital. We report the results of the first 2 years of CPSA implementation and an assessment of its performance., SETTING: The medical ED of a French 3,000-bed tertiary care hospital., METHOD: Between January 2008 and December 2009, adult patients visiting our medical ED were included during randomised time slots. Data were collected by pharmacy students. ADEs were documented by a trained physician pharmacist team using the chart review method., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome was the number of patients visiting our ED with an ADE. The CPSA attributes were assessed on the basis of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 2001 updated guidelines for evaluating public health surveillance systems., RESULTS: Of the 1,035 included patients, 201 experienced an ADE at the ED visit (19.4 \%; 95 \% confidence interval 15.8-23.0 \%). Forty-seven ADEs (23.4 \%) were unrelated to the patient's chief complaint. An ADE was the leading cause of 154 in the 1,035 admissions (14.9 \%). The assessment of our method on the basis of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines showed good performances in terms of data quality, stability, flexibility, timeliness, and acceptability, but not in terms of simplicity and representativeness. The profile of patients with an ADE at admission and detected ADEs did not significantly differ between years 2008 and 2009., CONCLUSION: Our experience demonstrates that clinical pharmacists can successfully implement a survey process of ADEs in an ED over time. Our method seems basic enough to suit most health care facilities with pharmacy students.}

  abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) resulting from antimicrobial use (AMU) is an emerging threat to global health. One of the key elements for a better understanding and management of AMU and AMR is to develop effective and efficient integrated surveillance systems that consider the complex epidemiology of these issues and the impacts of resistance on humans, animals and the environment. Consequently, for this project, an international consortium of experts from multiple fields called CoEvalAMR was formed with the objectives to study user needs, characterise and compare existing tools for the evaluation of integrated AMU and AMR surveillance, apply them to case studies, and elaborate guidance on the purpose-fit selection and the use of the tools. For the comparison of evaluation tools, questions were extracted from existing tools and attributed to themes, to assess the user needs, interviews were conducted with national key stakeholders, and we applied a series of different evaluation tools to understand and document their strengths and weaknesses. The guidance was refined iteratively. From 12 evaluation tools, 1117 questions/indicators were extracted and attributed to seven emerging themes. Twenty-three experts were interviewed, who suggested to increase the ease-of-use, grant open access, provide web-based interfaces and allow results to be automatically generated. Respondents also wished for tools providing the flexibility to conduct a rapid review, or an in-depth analysis of the surveillance system, depending on the evaluation objectives. The case studies emphasised that proper evaluations require adequate resources, typically requiring the involvement of several assessors and/or stakeholders, and can take weeks or months to complete. The resulting web-based guidance comprises six main sections: 1. Introduction to surveillance evaluation, 2. Evaluation of surveillance for AMU and AMR, 3. Evaluation tools, 4. Support for selecting an evaluation tool, 5. Case studies and 6. Directory of existing tools. The audience for the guidance is personnel working in public, private, and non-governmental organisations, from public health, animal health, plant health and environmental health, at local, national and international levels. We conclude that the field is challenged by opposing user needs for reduction and simplicity versus system approaches allowing the synthesis of that knowledge to sufficiently reflect the complexity of AMU and AMR ecology for real-world decisions. The CoEvalAMR web platform allows a better understanding of the different evaluation tools and assists users in the selection of an approach that corresponds to their evaluation needs. The CoEvalAMR consortium continues to address remaining gaps and consolidate evaluation tools and approaches in the future .},

  abstract = {Challenges calling for integrated approaches to health, such as the One Health (OH) approach, typically arise from the intertwined spheres of humans, animals, and ecosystems constituting their environment. Initiatives addressing such wicked problems commonly consist of complex structures and dynamics. As a result of the EU COST Action (TD 1404) "Network for Evaluation of One Health" (NEOH), we propose an evaluation framework anchored in systems theory to address the intrinsic complexity of OH initiatives and regard them as subsystems of the context within which they operate. Typically, they intend to influence a system with a view to improve human, animal, and environmental health. The NEOH evaluation framework consists of four overarching elements, namely: (1) the definition of the initiative and its context, (2) the description of the theory of change with an assessment of expected and unexpected outcomes, (3) the process evaluation of operational and supporting infrastructures (the "OH-ness"), and (4) an assessment of the association(s) between the process evaluation and the outcomes produced. It relies on a mixed methods approach by combining a descriptive and qualitative assessment with a semi-quantitative scoring for the evaluation of the degree and structural balance of "OH-ness" (summarised in an OH-index and OH-ratio, respectively) and conventional metrics for different outcomes in a multi-criteria-decision-analysis. Here, we focus on the methodology for Elements (1) and (3) including ready-to-use Microsoft Excel spreadsheets for the assessment of the "OH-ness". We also provide an overview of Element (2), and refer to the NEOH handbook for further details, also regarding Element (4) (http://neoh.onehealthglobal.net). The presented approach helps researchers, practitioners, and evaluators to conceptualise and conduct evaluations of integrated approaches to health and facilitates comparison and learning across different OH activities thereby facilitating decisions on resource allocation. The application of the framework has been described in eight case studies in the same Frontiers research topic and provides first data on OH-index and OH-ratio, which is an important step towards their validation and the creation of a dataset for future benchmarking, and to demonstrate under which circumstances OH initiatives provide added value compared to disciplinary or conventional health initiatives.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Buruli ulcer (BU) is one of the most neglected tropical diseases caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. M. ulcerans infection may manifest initially as a pre-ulcerative nodule, a plaque, or oedema which breaks down to form characteristic ulcers with undermined edges. The Ga West Municipality is an endemic area for Buruli ulcer, and we evaluated the BU surveillance system to determine whether the system is meeting its objectives and to assess its attributes., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a checklist based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated surveillance evaluation guidelines, 2006. We reviewed records and dataset on Buruli ulcer for the period 2011-2015. The evaluation was carried out at the national, regional, district, and community levels using the Ga West Municipality of the Greater Accra Region as a study site. Interviews with key stakeholders at the various levels were done using an interview guide, and observations were done with a checklist. Data were entered and analyzed using Epi info 7., RESULTS: A total of 594 cases of Buruli ulcer were reported from 2011 to 2015 in Ga West. The number of confirmed cases decreased from 109 in 2011 to 17 in 2015. The system was useful, fairly simple, flexible, representative, and fairly acceptable. The system was sensitive with a PVP of 45.3\%. Although the data quality was good with 85\% of case report forms completed, there was under-reporting (3.6\%), some discrepancies of data at the district, regional, and national levels. The system was moderately stable, and timeliness of reporting was 30.7\%., CONCLUSION: The Buruli ulcer surveillance system is meeting its set objectives, and the data generated are used to reliably describe the epidemiologic situation and evaluate the results for actions and plan future interventions. There is a need for timely submission of data. We recommend that the National Buruli Ulcer Control Program (NBUCP) provides logistical support to treatment centres.

  abstract = {Introduction: South Sudan has been implementing the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy since 2006, along with Early Warning and Alert Response and Network (EWARN). The IDSR/EWARN stakeholders commissioned an independent evaluation to establish performance at national, state, county, health facility, and community levels in the first half of 2021., Methods: the evaluation was conducted between June and September 2021 (during the COVID-19 pandemic) and was based on the World Health Organization (WHO) protocols for monitoring and evaluating communicable disease surveillance and response systems and the guidelines for evaluating EWARN., Results: integrated disease surveillance and response/early warning and alert response and network indicator data showed improving timeliness and completeness from the beginning of 2021 to week 16 and then a slight depression of timeliness by week 32, while completeness remained high. Event-based surveillance was active at the beginning of 2021 and in week 32. However, there was inadequate sample collection to investigate acute watery diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, and acute jaundice syndrome alerts. Respondents in all cadres had substantial experience working in IDSR/EWARN. All respondents performed the various IDSR/EWARN tasks and duties as expected, but needed more resources and training., Conclusion: while IDSR/EWARN is performing relatively well, confirmation of priority diseases by the laboratories needs to be strengthened. Health facilities need more regular supervision from the higher levels. Community health workers need more training on IDSR/EWARN. The whole IDSR/EWARN system needs more resources, particularly for communication and transport and to confirm priority diseases. Staff at all levels requested more training in IDSR/EWARN.

  abstract = {Background: Cancer notification has been mandatory in Ukraine since 1953, with the National Cancer Registry of Ukraine (NCRU) established in 1996. The aim of this study was to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the data quality at the NCRU. Methods: Qualitative and semi-quantitative methods were used to assess the comparability, completeness, validity and timeliness of cancer incidence data from the NCRU for the period 2002-2012. Results: Cancer registration procedures at the NCRU are in accordance with international standards and recommendations. Semi-quantitative methods suggested the NCRU's data was reasonably complete, although decreases in age-specific incidence and mortality rates in the elderly indicated some missing cases at older ages. The proportion of microscopically-verified cases increased from 73.6\% in 2002 to 82.3\% in 2012, with death-certificate-only (DCO) proportions stable at around 0.1\% and unknown stage recorded in 9.6\% of male and 7.5\% of female solid tumours. Timeliness was considered acceptable, with reporting {$>$}99\% complete within a turn-around time of 15 months. Conclusion: While timely reporting of national data reflects the advantages of a mandatory data collection system, a low DCO\% and observed age-specific declines suggest possible underreporting of incidence and mortality data, particularly at older ages. Overall, the evaluation indicates that the data are reasonably comparable and thus may be used to describe the magnitude of the cancer burden in Ukraine. Given its central role in monitoring and evaluation of cancer control activities, ensuring the sustainability of NCRU operations throughout the process of healthcare system reform is of utmost importance.},

Objective: To evaluate and follow-up on the qualitative and quantitative attributes of the HIV-AIDS notification process according to the established procedure of notification to the SIVIGILA in Caqueta, Colombia. Methods: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's methodology was used for evaluating the subsystem. Virtual surveys were carried out in 47 people in charge of the system in different territorial entities, and documents and databases were reviewed to examine qualitative attributes. In terms of analysis, triangulation in Epi-info was made in qualitative aspects, and frequency measurements were used in quantitative aspects. Results: The results are divided into eight categories. (a)Simplicity: it is easy to complete the records. (b)Flexibility: the subsystem has had different changes in terms of case definition and the inclusion of variables. (c)Acceptability: it is recognized the importance of monitoring HIV - AIDS and AIDS Mortality. (d)Opportunity: It is not opportune; there is no periodicity for the information analysis. (e)Representativeness: the total number of cases in the territory is not represented. (f)Utility: the subsystem allows the formulation of public policies. (g)Quality: there were 20 repeated cases.

  abstract = {Background: Surveillance of infectious diseases is recognized as the cornerstone of public health decision-making and practice. The aim of the evaluation of communicable diseases surveillance systems (CDSS) is ensuring that communicable diseases are monitored efficiently and effectively. The aim of this paper is to reflect on the experiences of both developed and developing countries in the evaluation of CDSS in order to learn lessons from these experiences to improve systems everywhere. Method(s): A literature review of studies published in English in PubMed and databases of the World Health Organization (WHO), and Center of Diseases Control (CDC) from 1981 to 2007 was undertaken assessing CDSS. The studies were divided into those from developed and developing countries. Result(s): A total of 32 studies were included, 20 from developed and twelve from developing countries. Both developed and developing countries faced difficulties in CDSS. Studies from the developed countries have been analysed based on the quality of the system alone. In developing countries, most of the studies have been on the integrated diseases surveillance (IDSR) and have been performed shortly after the adoption of the IDSR. Thus it might be too early to make a fair evaluation. Some of the systems over-centralized, while some lacked private health sector involvement in the system. Further, some of the systems were affected by conflicts and civil wars which are common problems in developing countries. Conclusion(s): None of the countries had ideal CDSS. The strategy of integrated diseases surveillance seems to be functioning well especially in Africa.},

This system is based on monitoring of presumptive malaria cases in the communities by which the number of presumptive cases exceeded a defined warning threshold value per month. The system was in the follow-up period shown to be very sensitive to variation of the coverage of anti-vector interventions: the number of presumptive cases decreased in the villages in which indoor spraying had been carried out and a minor increase was observed in those villages, where indoor spraying has been suspended. An increase of malaria cases was observed in 44 (20.8\%) out of 212 study sites in the same period. The increase was in particular predominant in areas at lower attitude at the outer zones of the central highlands.},

Objective(s): We evaluated AES/JE surveillance system in Deoria and Gorakhpur Districts to improve surveillance as per CDC recommended surveillance evalauation attributes. Method(s): We selected four blocks of Gorakhpur and Deoria districts to evaluate the AES surveillance based on selected CDC recommended attributes: data-quality, usefulness, representativeness, timeliness, acceptability, simplicity, and stability. We collected data using data abstraction forms by review of relevant reports and registers and interview of health workers. We studied 12 and 10 health facilities in Gorakhpur and Deoria districts respectively. Result(s): Of government health facilities in Gorakhpur and Deoria, 91\% and 93\% respectively were reporting, but no private facility was reporting. Of AES patients from Gorakhpur, 88\% had JE tests compared to 77\% from Deoria. Amongst AES deaths from Gorakhpur and Deoria, 83\% and 66\% respectively had been investigated. Among reported cases, 82\% and 73\% of cases were reported within 48hrs of onset in Gorakhpur and Deoria, and 91\% and 82\% of forms were complete. Most health workers (95\% in Gorakhpur, 93\% in Deoria) were able to recall correct case definition. Among health facilities, 88\% and 80\% didn't default in reporting {$>$}7 days consecutively anytime in one year. Conclusion(s): The AES / JE surveillance system in Deoria and Gorakhpur districts was useful for investigating deaths, representative of government health facilities, stable and timely for reporting, acceptable based on high reporting rates, and simple in terms of case definition recall.

  abstract = {Background: Yellow fever is common in tropical and subtropical areas of South America and Africa. Worldwide, about 600 million people live in endemic areas. The WHO estimates 200 000 cases of yellow fever worldwide each year. The yellow fever surveillance system is the designated system for early detection, preparedness, and notification of suspected travellers or a case. It was established in 1954. Objective(s): To determine whether the yellow fever surveillance system meets its objectives and to evaluate its attributes. Methodology: The study was conducted in March 2022 at Julius Nyerere International Airport. The CDC updated Guideline for Evaluating Public Health Surveillance System was used to evaluate the performance of the system using data from April 2021 to January 2022. Data was collected using an interview administered questionnaire, document review, and observation. Result(s): 17/22 staff completed the questionnaire. Of these 14(82.4\%) were Environmental Health Officers and 4(23.5\%) were laboratory technicians. From April 2021 to January 2022, 550,156 travellers were screened and verified yellow fever vaccination cards, 661 of these received vaccines at the airport arriving from yellow fever endemic countries. The overall performance for yellow fever surveillance was good. Key strengths of the system attributes were the simplicity (80\%), its data quality (90\%), its acceptability (70\%), its timeliness (100\%) and its flexibility (81.5\%), while stability (43\%) was not good due to insufficiency of training to port health officers on yellow fever surveillance. Sensitivity and Positive Predictive Value could not be evaluated. Conclusion(s): The yellow fever surveillance system is simple, acceptable, flexible, and sustainable at the airport. The system performed well in my evaluation. The system meets its objectives of surveillance. Key improvement would include the provision of training in yellow fever surveillance to port health officers.},

  abstract = {Objective: Reliable quantification of the burden of stroke in low- and middle-income (LMI) countries is difficult as population-based surveillance reports are scarce and may vary considerably in methodology. We aimed to evaluate all available primary stroke surveillance studies by applying components of a benchmark protocol (WHO STEPwise approach to stroke surveillance) and quantify the reported burden of stroke in LMI settings. Method(s): Electronic databases Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Knowledge were searched for population-based surveillance studies. Studies conducted in the LMI countries that reported on incident stroke were included. Data were extracted from each study using a prestructured format. Information on epidemiologic measures including crude and age-adjusted incidence rates, person-years, admission rates, case fatality rates, death certification, autopsy rates, measures of disability, and other study-specific information, in line with WHO STEPS stroke protocol, were recorded. Age-adjusted incidence rate data of stroke were combined using random-effects meta-analyses. Result(s): We identified 7 studies that reported on burden of stroke in 9 LMI countries, including aggregate information from 1,711,372 participants collected over 5,240,923 person-years. The age-adjusted incidence rates across the LMI countries varied widely, with the burden of total first-ever strokes ranging from 41 to 909 events per 100,000 person-years. Conclusion(s): Systematic evaluation of all available primary surveillance studies, particularly in the context of WHO STEPS guidelines, indicates inadequate adherence to standardized surveillance methodology in LMI countries. Incorporation of standardized approaches is essential to enhance generalizability and estimate stroke burden accurately in these resource-poor settings. {\copyright} 2013 American Academy of Neurology.},

  abstract = {Context: Birth defects prevention, research, education, and support activities can be improved through surveillance systems that collect high-quality data. Objective: To estimate the overall and defect-specific accuracy of Florida Birth Defects Registry (FBDR) data, describe reasons for false-positive diagnoses, and evaluate the impact of statewide case confirmation on frequencies and prevalence estimates. Design: Retrospective cohort evaluation study. Participants: A total of 8479 infants born to Florida resident mothers between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2011, and diagnosed with 1 of 13 major birth defects in the first year of life. Main Outcome Measures: Positive predictive value: calculated overall (proportion of FBDR-identified cases confirmed by medical record review, regardless of which of the 13 defects were confirmed) and defect-specific (proportion of FBDR-identified cases confirmed by medical record review with the same defect) indices. Results: The FBDR's overall positive predictive value was 93.3\% (95\% confidence interval, 92.7-93.8); however, there was variation in accuracy across defects, with positive predictive values ranging from 96.0\% for gastroschisis to 54.4\% for reduction deformities of the lower limb. Analyses suggested that International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition, Clinical Modification, codes, upon which FBDR diagnoses are based, capture the general occurrence of a defect well but often fail to identify the specific defect with high accuracy. Most infants with false-positive diagnoses had some type of birth defect that was incorrectly documented or coded. If prevalence rates reported by the FBDR for these 13 defects were adjusted to incorporate statewide case confirmation, there would be an overall 6.2\% rate reduction from 82.6 to 77.5 per 10 000 live births. Conclusions: A statewide birth defects surveillance system, relying on linkage of administrative databases, is capable of achieving high accuracy ({$>$}93\%) for identifying infants with any one of the 13 major defects included in this study. However, the level of accuracy and the ability to minimize false-positive diagnoses vary depending on the defect. {\copyright} Copyright 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.},

The goal of this study was to determine if the timeliness of the FBDR could be improved without significantly reducing the completeness of birth defect ascertainment., METHODS: Using 2006-2011 data from the FBDR, we first investigated the timing of diagnosis of birth defects by estimating the effect of different periods of follow-up on prevalence rates reported by the FBDR. We achieved this through retrospective reconstructions of the FBDR under 5 different scenarios with progressively narrower follow-up windows for each infant, and by comparing recalculated rates to the rate of the current FBDR with 1 year of follow-up. We then considered scenarios in which the time lag used to construct the FBDR was reduced (15, 12, 9, and 6 months) by using less data (from 7 to 4 quarters). Recalculated rates were again compared to the current FBDR constructed with 2 years of data and an 18-month lag. Analyses were performed overall and for 44 specific defects., RESULTS: During the 6-year study period, the FBDR identified more than 27,000 infants with a defect detected during the first year of life. Restricting follow-up from 1 year to 9 months would only result in a loss of 1.4\% of cases. Cutting follow-up in half to 6 months would miss 3.2\% of cases, although there was significant variation across defects. Improving timeliness had a small impact on completeness of ascertainment. Overall, compiling the FBDR with only 6 quarters of Florida Agency for Health Care Administration data (as opposed to 8 quarters) would improve timeliness by approximately 6 months, resulting in a registry that is 99.4\% complete., DISCUSSION: Six-to-nine month improvements in timeliness were achievable with a minimal sacrifice in completeness (0.6\%-1.7\%). Efforts to enhance data quality through the assessment of timeliness and completeness indicators are not unique to birth defects surveillance programs. Other programs, particularly those with similar passive case ascertainment protocols, can use our findings to consider a more timely release of registry data, or to design similar investigations of their own.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the quality of tuberculosis (TB) surveillance in Haiti, including whether underreporting from facilities to the national level contributes to low national case registration., METHODS: We collected 2010 and 2012 TB case totals, reviewed laboratory registries, and abstracted individual TB case reports from 32 of 263 anti-tuberculosis treatment facilities randomly selected after stratification/weighting toward higher-volume facilities. We compared site results to national databases maintained by a non-governmental organization partner (International Child Care [ICC]) for 2010 and 2012, and the National TB Program (Programme National de Lutte contre la Tuberculose, PNLT) for 2012 only., RESULTS: Case registries were available at 30/32 facilities for 2010 and all 32 for 2012. Totals of 3711 (2010) and 4143 (2012) cases were reported at the facilities. Case totals per site were higher in site registries than in the national databases by 361 (9.7\%) (ICC 2010), 28 (0.8\%) (ICC 2012), and 31 (0.8\%) cases (PNLT 2012). Of abstracted individual cases, respectively 11.8\% and 6.8\% were not recorded in national databases for 2010 (n = 323) and 2012 (n = 351)., CONCLUSIONS: The evaluation demonstrated an improvement in reporting registered TB cases to the PNLT in Haiti between 2010 and 2012. Further improvement in case notification will require enhanced case detection and diagnosis.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Birth defects are common, costly, and contribute substantially to infant mortality. The South Carolina Birth Defects Program (SCBDP) employs active population-based surveillance to monitor major birth defects statewide. We evaluated SCBDP's system attributes using published CDC guidelines., METHODS: To determine timeliness, completeness, and accuracy of birth defects information, we examined SCBDP's reports, program and education materials, advisory group meeting minutes, and strategic plan. We also met with program staff and stakeholders (n = 10) to discuss program goals and data utilization. We calculated the percentage of birth defects cases found 6 months after a birth cohort year for 2016-2018., RESULTS: SCBDP identifies 900-1,200 birth defects cases for a birth population of approximately 55,000 live births annually through active case reviews. SCBDP uses trained medical staff to abstract detailed information from maternal and infant medical records; SCBDP also has established auto-linkage with state vital statistics to capture demographic and birth data. SCBDP is timely and captures 97.1\% (range 96.7-97.6\%) of birth defects cases within 6 months after the birth cohort year closes. Active case identification using medical records as the primary data source improves quality assurance and completeness, while prepopulating demographic information improves timeliness., CONCLUSIONS: Given that birth defects significantly contribute to infant morbidity and mortality, monitoring these conditions is important to understand their impact on communities and to drive public health actions. SCBDP active surveillance and rigorous data quality practices provide the program with timely, complete, and accurate birth defects data. Copyright {\copyright} 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

  abstract = {Regular evaluation of integrated surveillance for antimicrobial use (AMU) and resistance (AMR) in animals, humans, and the environment is needed to ensure system effectiveness, but the question is how. In this study, six different evaluation tools were assessed after being applied to AMU and AMR surveillance in eight countries: (1) ATLASS: the Assessment Tool for Laboratories and AMR Surveillance Systems developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, (2) ECoSur: Evaluation of Collaboration for Surveillance tool, (3) ISSEP: Integrated Surveillance System Evaluation Project, (4) NEOH: developed by the EU COST Action "Network for Evaluation of One Health," (5) PMP-AMR: The Progressive Management Pathway tool on AMR developed by the FAO, and (6) SURVTOOLS: developed in the FP7-EU project "RISKSUR." Each tool was scored using (i) 11 pre-defined functional aspects (e.g., workability concerning the need for data, time, and people); (ii) a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT)-like approach of user experiences (e.g., things that I liked or that the tool covered well); and (iii) eight predefined content themes related to scope (e.g., development purpose and collaboration). PMP-AMR, ATLASS, ECoSur, and NEOH are evaluation tools that provide a scoring system to obtain semi-quantitative results, whereas ISSEP and SURVTOOLS will result in a plan for how to conduct evaluation(s). ISSEP, ECoSur, NEOH, and SURVTOOLS allow for in-depth analyses and therefore require more complex data, information, and specific training of evaluator(s). PMP-AMR, ATLASS, and ISSEP were developed specifically for AMR-related activities-only ISSEP included production of a direct measure for "integration" and "impact on decision making." NEOH and ISSEP were perceived as the best tools for evaluation of One Health (OH) aspects, and ECoSur as best for evaluation of the quality of collaboration. PMP-AMR and ATLASS seemed to be the most user-friendly tools, particularly designed for risk managers. ATLASS was the only tool focusing specifically on laboratory activities. Our experience is that adequate resources are needed to perform evaluation(s). In most cases, evaluation would require involvement of several assessors and/or stakeholders, taking from weeks to months to complete. This study can help direct future evaluators of integrated AMU and AMR surveillance toward the most adequate tool for their specific evaluation purpose.

  abstract = {Background: Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide with an estimated 10 million new (incident) TB cases in 2017. In Ghana, prevalence was estimated at 356 per 100,000 population and incidence of 160 per 100,000 population, mortality rate of 7.5 per 1000 infected people. The TB surveillance system exists to monitor TB burden in Ho and to improve the clinical outcomes of TB case patients. We evaluated the surveillance system at the Ho Municipality, Volta Region from 2014-2018 to determine its performance, usefulness and assess it system's attributes. Methods and materials: We extracted and reviewed data from reporting form and DHIMS 2 covering the period 2014-2018. We interviewed stakeholders at Ho Municipality using a semi structured questionnaire for information on case detection and clinical outcomes. We assessed the system attributes using the CDC updated guidelines for evaluating public health systems (2006). Summary descriptive statistics was performed on quantitative data and results were presented in tables and graphs. Result(s): Overall, 428 case of pulmonary TB were recorded in Ho Municipality for the evaluation period. The annual incidence of tuberculosis ranged from 1.6/100,000 in 2012 to 62.6/100,000 in 2014. The average case fatality rate was 8.3\%. The predictive value positive was 1.2\% (63/5876) in 2014 and 3.5\% (958/1635) in 2018. Data inconsistency in reporting ledgers 100\% (60/60) and DHIMS 40\% (24/60). Conclusion(s): The TB surveillance system was found to be useful and partially meeting its objectives. The system was complex and acceptable with good data quality. However, there is a need to improve data validation in the DHIMS 2 and laboratory capacity for timely results.Copyright {\copyright} 2020},

Existing guidelines lack the concreteness we deem necessary for them to be of practical use, especially concerning the establishment of new registries. Therefore, we propose adjustments and concretisations with regard to data quality, data privacy, data security and registry purposes.Materials and methods First, we separately elaborate on the issues to be included into the framework and present proposals for their improvements. Thereafter, we provide a framework for medical registries based on quasi-standard-operation procedures.Results The main result is a concise and scientifically based framework that tries to be both broad and concrete. Within that framework, we distinguish between data acquisition, data storage and data presentation as sub-headings. We use the framework to categorise and evaluate the data management processes of a German cancer registry.Discussion The standardisation of data management processes in medical registries is important to guarantee high quality of the registered data, to enhance the realisation of purposes, to increase efficiency and to enable comparisons between registries. Our framework is destined to show how one central impediment for such standardisations-lack of practicality-can be addressed on scientific grounds. {\copyright} Informa UK Ltd.},

  abstract = {The economic evaluation of health surveillance systems and of health information is a methodological challenge, as for information systems in general. Main present threads are considering cost-effectiveness solutions, minimizing costs for a given technically required output, or cost-benefit analysis, balancing costs with economic benefits of duly informed public interventions. The latter option, following a linear command-and-control perspective, implies considering a main causal link between information, decision, action, and health benefits. Yet, valuing information, taking into account its nature and multiple sources, the modalities of its processing cycle, from production to diffusion, decentralized use and gradual building of a shared information capital, constitutes a promising challenge. This work proposes an interdisciplinary insight on the value of health surveillance to get a renewed theoretical framework integrating information and informatics theory and information economics. The reflection is based on a typological approach of value, basically distinguishing between use and non-use values. Through this structured discussion, the main idea is to expand the boundaries of surveillance evaluation, to focus on changes and trends, on the dynamic and networked structure of information systems, on the contribution of diverse data, and on the added value of combining qualitative and quantitative information. Distancing itself from the command-and-control model, this reflection considers the behavioral fundaments of many health risks, as well as the decentralized, progressive and deliberative dimension of decision-making in risk management. The framework also draws on lessons learnt from recent applications within and outside of health sector, as in surveillance of antimicrobial resistance, inter-laboratory networks, the use of big data or web sources, the diffusion of technological products and large-scale financial risks. Finally, the paper poses the bases to think the challenge of a workable approach to economic evaluation of health Antoine-Moussiaux et al. Valuing Health Surveillance surveillance through a better understanding of health information value. It aims to avoid oversimplifying the range of health information benefits across society while keeping evaluation within the boundaries of what may be ascribed to the assessed information system.},

  abstract = {The PulseNet surveillance system is a molecular subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories designed to identify and facilitate investigation of foodborne illness outbreaks. This study estimates health and economic impacts associated with PulseNet. The staggered adoption of PulseNet across the states offers a natural experiment to evaluate its effectiveness, which is measured as reduction of reported illnesses due to improved information, enhanced industry accountability, and more-rapid recalls. Economic impacts attributable to PulseNet include medical costs and productivity losses averted due to reduced illness. Program costs are also reported. Better information and accountability from enhanced surveillance is associated with large reductions of reported illnesses. Data collected between 1994 and 2009 were assembled and analyzed between 2010 and 2015. Conservatively, accounting for underreporting and underdiagnosis, 266,522 illnesses from Salmonella, 9,489 illnesses from Escherichia coli (E. coli), and 56 illnesses due to Listeria monocytogenes are avoided annually. This reduces medical and productivity costs by \$507 million. Additionally, direct effects from improved recalls reduce illnesses from E. coli by 2,819 and Salmonella by 16,994, leading to \$37 million in costs averted. Annual costs to public health agencies are \$7.3 million. The PulseNet system makes possible the identification of food safety risks by detecting widespread or non-focal outbreaks. This gives stakeholders information for informed decision making and provides a powerful incentive for industry. Furthermore, PulseNet enhances the focus of regulatory agencies and limits the impact of outbreaks. The health and economic benefits from PulseNet and the foodborne disease surveillance system are substantial. Copyright {\copyright} 2016 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

  abstract = {Purpose: In April 2020, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention established the COVID-19 Electronic Laboratory Reporting program (CELR) to collect data on SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests. Over the course of the following year, the federal government, partnering with the Association for Public Health Laboratories, onboarded every state to submit laboratory results to this system-the first of its kind in the US. We set out to evaluate the quality of data collected by CELR. Methods \& Materials: We compared jurisdiction-level data collected through CELR and published by HHS to the testing data published by jurisdictions on their health department webpages. Because jurisdictions define their testing data differently, we anticipated some differences from federal testing data. However, jurisdictions also tend to prioritize their dashboard reporting-since it is what is used for policy decisions like reopening-so we hypothesized that differences from federal data absent a definitional explanation could point to problems with federal data. Where we found differences between jurisdictional and federal data, we conducted interviews with public health officials to understand their cause. Result(s): Of the 56 states and territories, as of April 2021 (the first month when all states were onboarded to CELR), 38 had federal total data that diverges from state data by more than 5\%. Of those states, the differences of 27 could not be explained by definitional factors. Based on our interviews, we identified three problems: non-electronic reporting streams, out-of-date surveillance systems, and deduplication of laboratory data. Conclusion(s): The federal testing dataset displays major unresolved quality problems, and because states present testing data so differently, state-published data forms a poor alternative to federal datasets. The federal government, which is uniquely positioned to provide testing data on infectious diseases, must work to improve the quality of laboratory data submissions by states. To support better national laboratory data, the United States should invest in updating state and laboratory data surveillance infrastructure-including updates to state surveillance systems and laboratory system updates to eliminate outdated reporting methods like faxes-and in creating more national laboratory data infrastructure.Copyright {\copyright} 2021},

  abstract = {PROBLEM/CONDITION: Hemophilia is an X-linked genetic disorder that primarily affects males and results in deficiencies in blood-clotting proteins. Hemophilia A is a deficiency in factor VIII, and hemophilia B is a deficiency in factor IX. Approximately one in 5,000 males are born with hemophilia, and hemophilia A is about four times as common as hemophilia B. Both disorders are characterized by spontaneous internal bleeding and excessive bleeding after injuries or surgery. Hemophilia can lead to repeated bleeding into the joints and associated chronic joint disease, neurologic damage, damage to other organ systems, and death. Although no precise national U.S. prevalence estimates for hemophilia exist because of the difficulty identifying cases among persons who receive care from various types of health care providers, two previous state-based studies estimated hemophilia prevalence at 13.4 and 19.4 per 100,000 males. In addition, these studies showed that 67\% and 82\% of persons with hemophilia received care in a federally funded hemophilia treatment center (HTC), and 86\% and 94\% of those with the most severe cases of hemophilia (i.e., those with the lowest levels of clotting factor activity in the circulating blood) received care in a federally funded HTC. As of January 2020, the United States had 144 HTCs., PERIOD COVERED: 1998-2019., DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM: Surveillance for hemophilia, which is a complex, chronic condition, is challenging because of its low prevalence, the difficulty in ascertaining cases uniformly, and the challenges in routinely characterizing and tracking associated health complications. Over time, two systems involving many stakeholders have been used to conduct ongoing hemophilia surveillance. During 1998-2011, CDC and the HTCs collaborated to establish the Universal Data Collection (UDC) surveillance system. The purposes of the UDC surveillance system were to monitor human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and bloodborne viral hepatitis in persons with hemophilia, thereby tracking blood safety, and to track the prevalence of and trends in complications associated with hemophilia. HTC staff collected clinical data and blood specimens from UDC participants and submitted them to CDC. CDC tested specimens for viral hepatitis and HIV. In 2011, the UDC surveillance system was replaced by a new hemophilia surveillance system called Community Counts. CDC and the HTCs established Community Counts to expand laboratory testing and the collection of clinical data to better identify and track emerging health issues in persons with hemophilia., RESULTS: This report is the first comprehensive summary of CDC's hemophilia surveillance program, which comprises both UDC and Community Counts. Data generated from these surveillance systems have been used in the development of public health and clinical guidelines and practices to improve the safety of U.S. blood products and either prevent hemophilia-related complications or identify complications early. Several factors have played a role in the effectiveness of the UDC and Community Counts systems, including 1) a stable data collection design that was developed and is continually reviewed in close partnership with HTC regional leaders and providers to ensure surveillance activities are focused on maximizing the scientific and clinical impact; 2) flexibility to respond to emerging health priorities through periodic updates to data collection elements and special studies; 3) high data quality for many clinical indicators and state-of-the-art laboratory testing methods for hemophilia treatment product inhibitors (developed and refined in part based on CDC research); 4) timely data and specimen collection and submission, laboratory specimen testing, analysis, and reporting; and 5) the largest and most representative sample of persons with hemophilia in the United States and one of the largest and most comprehensive data collection systems on hemophilia worldwide., INTERPRETATION: CDC has successfully developed, implemented, and maintained a surveillance system for hemophilia. The program can serve as an example of how to conduct surveillance for a complex chronic disease by involving stakeholders, improving and building new infrastructure, expanding data collection (e.g., new diagnostic assays), providing testing guidance, establishing a registry with specimen collection, and integrating laboratory findings in clinical practice for the individual patient., PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: Hemophilia is associated with substantial lifelong morbidity, excess premature deaths, and extensive health care needs throughout life. Through monitoring data from Community Counts, CDC will continue to characterize the benefits and adverse events associated with existing or new hemophilia treatment products, thereby contributing to maximizing the health and longevity of persons with hemophilia.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Surveillance for health outcomes is critical for rapid responses and timely prevention of disaster-related illnesses and injuries after a disaster-causing event. The Disaster Surveillance Workgroup (DSWG) of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention developed a standardized, single-page, morbidity surveillance form, called the Natural Disaster Morbidity Surveillance Individual Form (Morbidity Surveillance Form), to describe the distribution of injuries and illnesses, detect outbreaks, and guide timely interventions during a disaster., PROBLEM: Traditional data sources can be used during a disaster; however, supplemental active surveillance may be required because traditional systems often are disrupted, and many persons will seek care outside of typical acute care settings. Generally, these alternative settings lack health surveillance and reporting protocols. The need for standardized data collection was demonstrated during Hurricane Katrina, as the multiple surveillance instruments that were developed and deployed led to varied and uncoordinated data collection methods, analyses, and morbidity data reporting. Active, post-event surveillance of affected populations is critical for rapid responses to minimize and prevent morbidity and mortality, allocate resources, and target public health messaging., METHODS: The CDC and the Georgia Department of Public Health (GDPH) conducted a study to evaluate a Morbidity Surveillance Form to determine its ability to capture clinical presentations. The form was completed for each patient evaluated in an emergency department (ED) during triage from 01 August, 2007 through 07 August, 2007. Data from the form were compared with the ED discharge diagnoses from electronic medical records, and kappa statistics were calculated to assess agreement., RESULTS: Nine hundred forty-nine patients were evaluated, 41\% were male and 57\% were Caucasian. According to the forms, the most common reasons for seeking treatment were acute illness, other (29\%); pain (12\%); and gastrointestinal illness (8\%). The frequency of agreement between discharge diagnoses and the form ranged from 3 to 100\%. Kappa values ranged from 0.23-1.0, with nine of the 12 categories having very good or good agreement., CONCLUSION: With modifications to increase sensitivity for capturing certain clinical presentations, the Morbidity Surveillance Form can be a useful tool for capturing data needed to guide public health interventions during a disaster. A validated collection instrument for a post-disaster event facilitates rapid and standardized comparison and aggregation of data across multiple jurisdictions, thus, improving the coordination, timeliness, and accuracy of public health responses. The DSWG revised the Morbidity Surveillance Form based on information from this study.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Neural tube defects (NTDs), including spina bifida, encephalocele, and anencephaly, are severe congenital conditions that are readily identifiable at birth and therefore less likely than other birth defects to be misdiagnosed or under-reported. We tested the hypothesis that, because of the relatively straightforward diagnosis of NTDs, accurate estimates of NTD prevalence can be directly estimated from reports to the Alaska Birth Defects Registry (ABDR)--a passive surveillance system receiving reports from all Alaska hospitals and other sources. METHODS: We reviewed medical records for potential NTD-affected births identified by the ABDR and Alaska birth certificates. Case verification findings were linked to Alaska birth certificate data and overall and specific positive predictive values (PPV) computed. RESULTS: Alaska Birth Defects Registry-specific PPV was 44\%. Positive predictive values did not differ by Alaska Native status even when data were stratified by number of NTD reports submitted, age at diagnosis, or birth year. Systematic exclusion of reporting sources with poor PPV resulted in a 28\% improvement of PPV to 57\%. The Alaska Native/non-Native ratio for unconfirmed NTD reports (0.7) was identical to the Alaska Native/non-Native ratio for confirmed NTD cases. CONCLUSIONS: Unverified ABDR registry data is useful for identifying relative differences in NTD risk for Alaskan populations, but is unreliable for calculating NTD prevalence estimates or for evaluating preventive interventions. Systematic approaches to improving PPV may be useful for generating NTD prevalence estimates from unverified registry data when case verification is impractical.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mandatory notification of invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections was introduced for laboratories in Germany in 2009. The aims were to support local health authorities (LHAs) in their mandate to prevent and control infections in hospitals and to improve population-based nationwide surveillance of healthcare associated infections. We evaluated the MRSA surveillance system to assess whether its aims were met and to identify areas for improvement., METHODS: Using the updated guidelines for evaluating public health surveillance systems by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention we assessed the attributes simplicity, timeliness, data quality, acceptability, and usefulness. In 2016/2017 we interviewed staff in LHAs, state health authorities (SHAs), and laboratories and analyzed surveillance data of cases notified between 2009 and 2016., RESULTS: We interviewed 10\% of LHAs (n = 38), 63\% of SHAs (n = 10), 5 selected laboratories and analyzed information on 27,706 notified MRSA cases. LHAs reported that on receiving notifications from laboratories they contacted hospitals for clinical information, which was time-consuming and complicated as physicians were hard to reach or refused to answer questions, citing doctor-patient confidentiality. LHAs suggested reducing the amount of information collected as some clinical information was unnecessary for implementing control measures. LHAs stated that they received notifications on time, however surveillance data analysis showed some delay. Data completeness exceeded 90\% for most variables, however it was only 68\% and 80\% for dates of disease onset and hospital admission respectively making it impossible to discriminate between hospital and community acquired infections in half of the cases. The surveillance system was well accepted by half of the interviewees. A third however stated that the benefits of the surveillance system were outweighed by the work associated with it. The majority rated the system to be useful for recognizing trends in the MRSA incidence and the ability to check up on infection control measures in hospitals., CONCLUSIONS: The surveillance system proved to be useful by fulfilling its aims. It was timely, acceptable and provided complete data for most variables. However, the system was complicated; ensuring that only relevant variables are reported could simplify the system without losing any of its usefulness.},

To prevent disease transmission into commercial pig herds, it is therefore vital to have knowledge about the disease status in wild boar. In the present study, we performed a comprehensive evaluation of alternative surveillance strategies for Classical Swine Fever (CSF) in wild boar and compared them with the currently implemented conventional approach. The evaluation protocol was designed using the EVA tool, a decision support tool to help in the development of an economic and epidemiological evaluation protocol for surveillance. To evaluate the effectiveness of the surveillance strategies, we investigated their sensitivity and timeliness. Acceptability was analysed and finally, the cost-effectiveness of the surveillance strategies was determined. We developed 69 surveillance strategies for comparative evaluation between the existing approach and the novel proposed strategies. Sampling only within sub-adults resulted in a better acceptability and timeliness than the currently implemented strategy. Strategies that were completely based on passive surveillance performance did not achieve the desired detection probability of 95\%. In conclusion, the results of the study suggest that risk-based approaches can be an option to design more effective CSF surveillance strategies in wild boar.},

  abstract = {Digital disease detection tools are technologically sophisticated, but dependent on digital information, which for many areas suffering from high disease burdens is simply not an option. In areas where news is often reported in local media with no digital counterpart, integration of local news information with digital surveillance systems, such as HealthMap (Boston Children's Hospital), is critical. Little research has been published in regards to the specific contribution of local health-related articles to digital surveillance systems. In response, the USAID PREDICT project implemented a local media surveillance (LMS) pilot study in partner countries to monitor disease events reported in print media. This research assessed the potential of LMS to enhance digital surveillance reach in five low- and middle-income countries. Over 16 weeks, select surveillance system attributes of LMS, such as simplicity, flexibility, acceptability, timeliness, and stability were evaluated to identify strengths and weaknesses in the surveillance method. Findings revealed that LMS filled gaps in digital surveillance network coverage by contributing valuable localized information on disease events to the global HealthMap database. A total of 87 health events were reported through the LMS pilot in the 16-week monitoring period, including 71 unique reports not found by the HealthMap digital detection tool. Furthermore, HealthMap identified an additional 236 health events outside of LMS. It was also observed that belief in the importance of the project and proper source selection from the participants was crucial to the success of this method. The timely identification of disease outbreaks near points of emergence and the recognition of risk factors associated with disease occurrence continue to be important components of any comprehensive surveillance system for monitoring disease activity across populations. The LMS method, with its minimal resource commitment, could be one tool used to address the information gaps seen in global 'hot spot' regions.}

  abstract = {Since 2005 a sentinel system for surveillance of nosocomial diseases has been introduced in Romania which had, among other objectives, the evaluation of antibiotic resistance. The surveillance methodology was shared annually, the number of participants varying between 12 and 40 hospitals. During 2005-2008 the Reference Laboratory for Nosocomial Infections and Antibiotic Resistance in the "Cantacusino" NIRDMI received 1481 bacterial strains, comprising 531 S. aureus, 486 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 439 enterobacteria and 25 enterococci strains. The resistance percents widely differred for some species, especially regarding the type of hospital unit that sent the strains (ex., Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated form patients with burns). A great variability was noted concerning the manner in which nominalized hospitals responded to the solicitations in the methodology that was shared. especially regarding participation to a national bank for bacterial strains. Only for 5 out of the 40 hospitals that participated along the 4 years in the sentinel programme the annual comparative evaluations of antibiotic resistance were achieved. for a small number of microorganisms that underwent surveillance (S. aureus, E. coli). Among the strong points of the system we can point out: unity in methodology; working protocols for microbiological investigation given to all the participants; special forms for reporting. Among the weak points, we consider: modification in the number of participant hospitals during the program: unequal participation of hospitals, with unwanted effects on the sample representativity of analysed microbial strains; difficulties in stocking and processing laboratory data. In order to increase the quality of data provided, we consider the following as useful: harmonization of the objectives regarding integrated surveillance of nosocomial infections and antibiotic resistance in hospital environment, correlated with the ECDC demands and recommendations; inclusion in the system of sanitary units that fit the needs of the program fir microbiological identification and investigation of nosocomial infections; intensification of the training activities of persons involved in the program, regardless of the level of responsibility and the acknowledgement of each person's responsibilities in nosocomial infection monitoring; external and internal control implementation in the laboratories: selection of aspects concerning the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance that come out during surveillance in order to be studied using molecular methods for the emphasizing of mechanisms and causes, in view of implementing measures for prevention and control; evaluation of the necessity for molecular investigation in view of identifying resistant bacterial clones in the hospitals in Romania etc.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Australia declared freedom from bovine tuberculosis (TB) in accordance with international guidelines in 1997 and has since maintained ongoing surveillance for this disease, primarily through abattoir surveillance of cattle carcases (meat inspection) for TB-like granulomas. The objectives of this study were to estimate the sensitivity of Australia's surveillance system and quantify the probability that Australia is free from bovine TB at the specified design prevalence., METHODS: The analysis included approximately 80 million records of individual cattle slaughtered and meat inspected at Australian abattoirs between 2005 and 2015 calendar years. Animals were identified and aggregated by property of birth within year. Herd- and population-level sensitivities and probability of freedom were estimated on an annual basis using a simulation model to account for uncertainty about the unit sensitivity of the meat inspection process., RESULTS: The estimated median population sensitivity of Australia's TB surveillance system varied from a high of 80\%, in years when traditional meat inspection was used, to as low as 50\% after the introduction of visual-only meat inspection, for a design prevalence of 0.01\% (19 herds) of Australian breeding cattle herds and 0.5\% of animals within infected herds. The level of confidence in Australia's freedom from bovine TB was {$>$}95\% after the first year of the analysis and {$>$}99.5\% from 2007 through to the end of the analysis period in 2015. Reducing the animal-level or herd-level design prevalence, or the estimated sensitivity of meat inspection, reduced system sensitivity but confidence of disease freedom remained high., CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated a very high level of confidence that Australia's cattle herd is truly free from bovine TB. Meat inspection for granulomas in the head and thorax of slaughtered cattle underpins this result by providing surveillance data on an extremely large number of animals each year.

Objective(s): The objectives of measles surveillance include predicting outbreaks by identifying geographic locations and age groups at risk and evaluating vaccination strategies. We described the surveillance system, assessed the system attributes and performance indicators. Method(s): We engaged and interviewed 20 stakeholders using CDC 2001 guidelines for evaluating public health surveillance system and Guidelines for Measles Surveillance and Outbreak response in Nigeria to assess the system's attributes and performance indicators. We obtained measles surveillance data from Edo State Ministry of Health. Data was analyzed using Epi Info 7.0 Results: Out of 142 suspected cases, seven (4.9\%) were laboratory confirmed (Measles IgM+). Only one (5.5\%) Local Government Areas (LGA) reported at least 2 cases a year (Target {$>$}= 80\%). Annual rate of investigation of suspected measles case was 4.4/100,000(Target {$>$}=2/ 100,000).

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends periodic evaluations of influenza surveillance systems to identify areas for improvement and provide evidence of data reliability for policymaking. However, data on the performance of established influenza surveillance systems are limited in Africa, including Tanzania. We aimed to assess the usefulness of the Influenza surveillance system in Tanzania and to ascertain if the system meets its objectives, including; estimating the burden of disease caused by the Influenza virus in Tanzania and identifying any circulating viral strains with pandemic potential., METHODOLOGY: From March to April 2021, we collected retrospective data through a review of the Tanzania National Influenza Surveillance System electronic forms for 2019. Furthermore, we interviewed the surveillance personnel about the system's description and operating procedures. Case definition (ILI-Influenza Like Illness and SARI-Severe Acute Respiratory Illness), results, and demographic characteristics of each patient were obtained from the Laboratory Information System (Disa*Lab) at Tanzania National Influenza Center. The United States Centers for disease control and prevention updated guidelines for evaluating public health surveillance systems were used to evaluate the system's attributes. Additionally, the system's performance indicators (including turnaround time) were obtained by evaluating Surveillance system attributes, each being scored on a scale of 1 to 5 (very poor to excellent performance)., RESULTS: A total of 1731 nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples were collected from each suspected influenza case in 2019 from fourteen (14/14) sentinel sites of the influenza surveillance system in Tanzania. Laboratory-confirmed cases were 21.5\% (373/1731) with a predictive value positive of 21.7\%. The majority of patients (76.1\%) tested positive for Influenza A. Thirty-seven percent of patients' results met the required turnaround time, and 40\% of case-based forms were incompletely filled. Although the accuracy of the data was good (100\%), the consistency of the data was below (77\%) the established target of {$>$}= 95\%., CONCLUSION: The overall system performance was satisfactory in conforming with its objectives and generating accurate data, with an average performance of 100\%. The system's complexity contributed to the reduced consistency of data from sentinel sites to the National Public Health Laboratory of Tanzania. Improvement in the use of the available data could be made to inform and promote preventive measures, especially among the most vulnerable population. Increasing sentinel sites would increase population coverage and the level of system representativeness. Copyright: {\copyright} 2023 Shedura et al.

Both indicator-based and event-based surveillance were employed. The performance of the system between 7 March and 29 May 2016 was evaluated. Users' experience with the system was assessed in interviews using a semi-structured questionnaire and by a cross-sectional survey. The system's performance was assessed using data from the EWARS database., FINDINGS: Indicator-based surveillance recorded 34 113 cases of the nine syndromes under surveillance among 326 861 consultations. Three confirmed outbreaks were detected, and no large outbreak was missed. Users were satisfied with the performance of EWARS and judged it useful for timely monitoring of disease trends and outbreak detection. The system was simple, stable and flexible and could be rapidly deployed during a health emergency. The automated collation, analysis and dissemination of data reduced the burden on surveillance teams, saved human resources, minimized human error and ensured teams could focus on public health responses., CONCLUSION: In Fiji, EWARS in a Box was effective in strengthening disease surveillance during a national emergency and was well regarded by users.},

  abstract = {Objective: Several methods have been suggested for evaluation of population-based cancer registries (PBCR) worldwide. However, most of these methods evaluate the data and outputs of the cancer registries. This study aimed to develop a comprehensive tool and protocol for evaluation of inputs, processes and outputs of a PBCR. Methods: The standards of the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR) were used to draft a comprehensive checklist. In addition, the national guidelines of PBCR were used to develop a questionnaire for evaluation of knowledge and practice of the PBCR personnel. Furthermore, a protocol for evaluation of the completeness and validity of the PBCR data was developed according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and the NAACCR guidelines. A 0--4 Likert based score and expert opinions (10 experts) were used to assess validity of the eight questionnaires/checklists. A modified Delphi method was applied to validate the checklists and questionnaires. Questions with a score higher than 3 remained in the final tools. Results: The final package consists of 546 questions including 108 (19.8\%) for evaluation of guidelines, 54 (9.9\%) for analysis and reports, 87 (15.9\%) for governance and infrastructure, 155 (28.4\%) for information technology, 21 (3.8\%) for personnel knowledge and 121 (22.2\%) for their practice. Additionally, data quality indicators were also considered for evaluation of PBCRs. Conclusion: This comprehensive tool can be used to show the gaps and limitations of the PBCR programs and provide informative clues for their improvement. {\copyright} 2018},

In Mexico, assessments of officially reported burden have not been previously reported. To evaluate discontinuity between surveillance data and data from other sources, we used data from the Mexican Ministry of Health to describe the distribution of reported Chagas disease over time in Mexico and compare it with estimates from the literature., METHODS: We summarized age and sex differences for Chagas cases and mortality for 1995-2013 and 1982-2010, respectively. We examined the spatial distribution of Chagas disease over time with respect to disease burden. We further compared officially reported figures with estimates from the literature., RESULTS: Among 6,494 officially reported cases, rates of Chagas disease were highest in adults aged 25-44 years (47.3\%). Mortality was highest in adults aged {$>$}=45 years (423/495, 85.5\%). The data indicated increasing temporal trends for incidence and mortality. The greatest burden occurred in southern states, with increasing spatial distribution over time. Fewer than 900 cases and 40 deaths were officially reported annually, in contrast to estimates from the literature of approximately 69,000 new cases and 25,000 deaths annually., CONCLUSION: While increasing trends in officially reported data have been observed, large discrepancies in case estimates compromise our understanding of Chagas disease epidemiology. Reported cases based on current practices are not enough to correctly assess the Chagas disease burden and spatial distribution in Mexico. Understanding the true epidemiology of this disease will lead to more focused and successful control and prevention strategies to decrease disease burden.},

To evaluate the quality of China CJD surveillance system, the collections of the clinical and epidemiological information, the sampling, the clinical examinations and laboratory tests and follow-up survey were separately analyzed based on the data from 2010 to 2015. The obtaining rates of clinical-information table, epidemiological-information table, sample inspection sheet and medical record of the referring patients from reporting units to the center of CJD surveillance maintained or reached at very high levels, being close to 100\% in the past 3 y. 93.82\%, 85.23\%, 96.21\% and 94.70\% of the reported cases had the data of MRI, EEG, CSF 14-3-3 and PRNP sequencing, respectively. Follow-up surveys were conducted in about 50\% cases in 2010 and 2011, 93.39\% cases in 2012 and 100\% cases in the last 3 y.

We used logistic regression techniques to estimate reporting completeness by disease, year, and health care system. The completeness of reporting varied among the health care systems from 2\% to 30\% and improved over time. Disease-specific reporting completeness proportions ranged from 0\% to 82\%, but were generally low even for diseases with great public health importance and opportunity for interventions.}

The German "Protection Against Infection Act" (IfSG) provides a mandate to the Robert Koch-Institute (RKI) to establish sentinel surveillance of not notifiable diseases relevant to public health. Sentinel systems with RKI involvement include two networks of private practitioners reporting cases of influenza and measles (within the Working Groups on Influenza and Measles, respectively). In addition a laboratory-based sentinel system reports cases of certain bacterial infections in children. Results from these systems serve as a basis for framing vaccination recommendations and goals as well as for the evaluation, adjustment and promotion of vaccination strategies. The data indicate time trends (e. g. number of cases by season, age and region) and supply specific information (e. g. for determination of risk factors, distribution of pathogens). Methodological problems of sentinel surveys (e. g. selection of appropriate samples, population-based estimates) can be accounted for with appropriate methods of analysis. More effective implementation of sentinel surveillance in Germany could be achieved through better coordination of existing structures. This would make more effective use of limited resources and better enable timely and flexible investigation of conceptual and organisational questions.}

Data available in the National Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN), from 2012 to 2014, were used to calculate 14 indicators relating to four attributes: completeness, consistency, timeliness and acceptability. The study made use of cluster analysis to group micro-regions according to acceptability and timeliness. Three clusters were identified among the 473 micro-regions with optimal or regular completeness (70\% to 100\%) and with over five notifications. Cluster 1 (n=109) presented mean timeliness of notification and treatment equal to 62.8\% and 24.9\%, respectively. Cluster 2 (n=143) had a mean percentage of cases tested for HIV equal to 55.9\%. Cluster 3 (n=221) had the best performing tuberculosis indicators. Results suggest priority areas for improving surveillance of tuberculosis, predominantly in the central-north part of the country. They also point to the need to increase the timeliness of treatment and the percentage of cases tested for HIV.},

  abstract = {Background: Over the past decade, influenza surveillance has been established in several African countries including Zambia. However, information on the on data quality and reliability of established influenza surveillance systems in Africa are limited. Such information would enable countries to assess the performance of their surveillance systems, identify shortfalls for improvement and provide evidence of data reliability for policy making and public health interventions. Methods: We used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines to evaluate the performance of the influenza surveillance system (ISS) in Zambia during 2011-2017 using 9 attributes: (i) data quality and completeness, (ii) timeliness, (iii) representativeness, (iv) flexibility, (v) simplicity, (vi) acceptability, (vii) stability, (viii) utility, and (ix) sustainability. Each attribute was evaluated using pre-defined indicators. For each indicator we obtained the proportion (expressed as percentage) of the outcome of interest over the total. A scale from 1 to 3 was used to provide a score for each attribute as follows: {$<$} 60\% (as obtained in the calculation above) scored 1 (weak performance); 60-79\% scored 2 (moderate performance); {$\geq$}80\% scored 3 (good performance). An overall score for each attribute and the ISS was obtained by averaging the scores of all evaluated attributes. Results: The overall mean score for the ISS in Zambia was 2.6. Key strengths of the system were the quality of data generated (score: 2.9), its flexibility (score: 3.0) especially to monitor viral pathogens other than influenza viruses, its simplicity (score: 2.8), acceptability (score: 3.0) and stability (score: 2.6) over the review period and its relatively low cost (\$310,000 per annum). Identified weaknesses related mainly to geographic representativeness (score: 2.0), timeliness (score: 2.5), especially in shipment of samples from remote sites, and sustainability (score: 1.0) in the absence of external funds. Conclusions: The system performed moderately well in our evaluation. Key improvements would include improvements in the timeliness of samples shipments and geographical coverage. However, these improvements would result in increased cost and logistical complexity. The ISSS in Zambia is largely reliant on external funds and the acceptability of maintaining the surveillance system through national funds would require evaluation.},

This meant information available in the official web sites of the "KOSTRA-data" (Municipality-State-Report) in Norway, the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare ("Socialstyrelsen") and Oral Health Register (the SCOR system, National Board of Health) in Denmark., RESULTS: A potential for increasing the reliability and validity of the data existed. Routines for monitoring other oral diseases than caries were limited. Compared with the other Scandinavian countries, the data collection system in Denmark appeared more functional and had adopted more modern concepts of disease management than other systems. In the light of modern concepts of caries management, data collected elsewhere had limited utility., CONCLUSIONS: The Scandinavian systems of health reporting had much in common, but some essential differences existed. If the quality of epidemiological data were enhanced, it would be possible to use the data for planning oral health care. Routines and procedures should be improved and updated in accordance with the modern ideas about caries prevention and therapy. For appropriate oral health planning in an organised dental service, reporting of enamel caries is essential.}

Deaths from these injuries were identified from Maryland vital statistics over 7 years. The work-relatedness of these injuries and sensitivity of reporting were determined from death certificates, medical examiner reports, the National Traumatic Occupational Fatality System (NTOF), the Maryland Occupational Safety and Health Administration (MOSH), and Workers' Compensation (WC) data., RESULTS: A total of 527 deaths were identified for ages 16 and above, of which, 45\% were work-related. Identification of work-related deaths varied by source: medical examiner (100\%), death certificates (89\%), NTOF (68\%), MOSH (59\%), and WC (44\%). Reporting differed by age, cause of injury, year, occupation, and industry., CONCLUSIONS: Examination of work-relatedness for deaths from certain causes is an efficient means of evaluating the quality of occupational injury reporting source data. These sentinel injuries uncovered significant underreporting in sources used by national surveillance systems, resulted in improved NTOF reporting, and suggest the need to make more use of medical examiner data when available.}

Age- and sex-specific reporting rates were compared during the period 1997-2006. During the ten-year period studied 168,089 cases were recorded via ZUBSTAT, and 128,222 cases by SURVIVAL. On average 76.2\% (range: 62.9\%-94.9\%) were notified. In both datasets, the notified incidence of varicella was highest for preschool children, with a downward shift in age at contracting varicella. The percentage of notified cases decreased with increasing age. The number of hospitalized cases was low for BOLOB and SURVIVAL. On average 74\% of hospitalized cases were reported. The mandatory notification system in Slovenia provides enough information to survey age/sex-specific varicella trends in the prevaccine era.}

These changes have prompted renewed interest in expanding surveillance to include HIV and have engendered national debate on whether an HIV surveillance system should be based on reports of the names of infected individuals or employ non-name-based data codes. In 1994, the state of Maryland implemented a program to require HIV surveillance by unique identifier (UI) patient code. This evaluation of Maryland's program found that when complete, the 12-digit UI number provided a virtually unduplicated count 99.8\% unique, was 99.9\% unique with only the last four digits of the U.S. government Social Security Number (SSN), date of birth (DOB), and race, and 77.7\% unique if the last four digits of the SSN were missing. Health care providers were willing to create the UI, with DOB and gender present 98.3\% and 98.8\% of the time, race was complete 84.1\% and last four digits of SSN were complete 72.4\%. The overall completeness of reporting for HIV tests was 87.8\%.and 84.8\%, respectively, using different methodologies. Evidence from the Maryland UI evaluation demonstrates that a non-name-based system can provide accurate, timely and valid data concerning the scope of the HIV epidemic, without the creation of state-wide name-based registry.},

Both systems demonstrated timely reporting; the median time from date of HIV test to receipt of report by the state health department was 20 days in Maryland and 59 days (60\% of reports) or 173 days (40\% of reports), in Texas. Although data from both states indicated increases in reporting of the social security number (SSN) data element during the evaluation period, 22\% of reports in Maryland and 34\% in Texas were missing the SSN element, which contributed to a high rate of incomplete case reporting.},

This is an internal evaluation method, implemented by the coordinators in collaboration with all the actors of the network. Its purpose is to detect weak points in order to optimize management. A method for the development of performance indicators of epidemiological surveillance networks was developed in 2004 and was applied to several networks. Its implementation requires a thorough description of the network environment and all its activities to define priority indicators. Since this method is considered to be complex, our objective consisted in developing a simplified approach and applying it to an epidemiological surveillance network., METHODS: We applied the initial method to a theoretical network model to obtain a list of generic indicators that can be adapted to any surveillance network., RESULTS: We obtained a list of 25 generic performance indicators, intended to be reformulated and described according to the specificities of each network. It was used to develop performance indicators for RESAPATH, an epidemiological surveillance network of antimicrobial resistance in pathogenic bacteria of animal origin in France., CONCLUSION: This application allowed us to validate the simplified method, its value in terms of practical implementation, and its level of user acceptance. Its ease of use and speed of application compared to the initial method argue in favor of its use on broader scale. Copyright {\copyright} 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The present thesis, which is based on a review and 12 published articles, concerns clinical epidemiological methods [ 176-187]. The Nordic countries have for many years established numerous registries. The establishment in Denmark of the National Population Registry in 1924 and the personal registration number (the CPR number) in 1968 allowed person-identification of remarkable quality, and made it possible to gather information on the same person in several registries. This situation is unique to the Nordic countries. The administrative registries were not primarily established for research purposes but have often proved a valuable tool in research. Despite the extensive use of registries in research, the methodological literature on this subject is limited. The purpose of the present thesis was: 1) to analyse strengths and limitations in using regional administrative registries in research, 2) to develop a framework for evaluation of existing registries for use in clinical epidemiological research, 3) to develop methods for evaluation of the data quality in regional registries, and 4) to evaluate tour regional Danish administrative health registries for use in clinical epidemiological research. The analyses of strengths. limitations and data quality were based on studies of data from the regional hospital information systems, health service registries, and public health officers' surveillance system for strong analgesics and notifiable diseases. Against the background of the studies, the many advantages of using registries in research are discussed. The most important advantage is that data already exist and time consumption is thus considerably reduced, compared with studies based on collection of primary data. Costs are also considerably reduced. Other advantages included the generally large sample sizes, which provide great precision in estimates and which allow the study of rare exposures, diseases and other effects, Typically, the registries are complete as far as the persons in the target population are concerned; this ensures representativeness. Collection of registry data has been done independently of the present study, and this often reduces various types of bias such as recall, non-response, and influence on the diagnostic process determined by the study. A number of health problems manifest themselves many years after the exposure, and existing registries are thus especially valuable when studying diseases with a long period between exposure and disease manifestation. The limitations in the use of registries are considerable and often ignored, The most significant problems are related to data selection and data quality because the data collection method is determined by the registry. The studies have varied in quality, which is often evaluated at regional level, since the same information is usually stored in several registries, This allows for comparison with respect to the completeness and validity of the data. The use of discharge diagnoses from hospital registries involves considerable data quality problems, while data from the health service registries, and from the public health officers' surveillance system for strong analgesics and notifiable diseases are of satisfactory quality. Misclassification of data exists, however, in all data sources; this can only be revealed by comprehensive studies of the validity of the data quality.},

A draft framework for evaluating syndromic surveillance systems will help researchers and public health practitioners working on nontraditional surveillance to review their work in a systematic way and communicate their efforts. The framework will also guide public health practitioners in their efforts to compare and contrast aspects of syndromic surveillance systems and decide whether and how to develop and maintain such systems. In addition, a common framework will allow the identification and prioritization of research and evaluation needs. The evaluation framework is comprised of five components: a thorough description of the system (e.g., purpose, stakeholders, how the system works); system performance experience (e.g., usefulness, acceptability to stakeholders, generalizability to other settings, operating stability, costs); capacity for outbreak detection (e.g., flexibility to adapt to changing risks and data inputs, sensitivity to detect outbreaks, predictive value of system alarms for true outbreaks, timeliness of detection); assessment of data quality (e.g., representativeness of the population covered by the system, completeness of data capture, reliability of data captured over time); and conclusions and recommendations. The draft framework is intended to evolve into guidance to support public health practice for terrorism preparedness and outbreak detection.},

Therefore, figures on occupational diseases are not comparable between countries and are often regarded as not reliable even within a country. Still, registries of occupational diseases are an important source for policy on occupational safety and health., AIMS: To evaluate registries of occupational diseases in European (EU) countries for their ability to provide appropriate information for preventive policy., METHODS: Contact persons of national registries for occupational diseases in six countries were sent a questionnaire on the objectives of their registry and on the quality of monitoring time trends and alerting to new risks. An auditor then visited each contact person, discussed the completed questionnaire and sent a draft audit report to the contact person for verification. Two reviewers then established a quality score based on the verified audit report. The results of the audit were sent to each contact person, who was asked to evaluate the usefulness of the audit instrument for future quality improvement of the registry., RESULTS: The objectives of the registries assessed in the six countries were compensation, provision of statistics, prevention and research. The average quality was rated 3.2 (SD 2.2) out of 10 for monitoring occupational diseases and 5.3 (SD 1.4) out of 10 for alerting to new risks. The main reasons for the low scores were inadequate education and training of physicians and poor participation of notifying physicians. Three of the six contact persons (50\%) agreed that the audit could actually contribute to future quality improvement of the registry in relation to prevention., CONCLUSIONS: Registries in EU countries do not adequately monitor existing occupational diseases or adequately alert to newly occurring occupational diseases. There is an urgent need to improve the education and participation of notifying physicians.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The timely identification of a cluster is a critical requirement for infection prevention and control (IPC) departments because these events may represent transmission of pathogens within the health care setting. Given the issues with manual review of hospital infections, a surveillance system to detect clusters in health care settings must use automated data capture, validated statistical methods, and include all significant pathogens, antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, patient care locations, and health care teams., METHODS: We describe the use of SaTScan statistical software to identify clusters, WHONET software to manage microbiology laboratory data, and electronic health record data to create a comprehensive outbreak detection system in our hospital. We also evaluated the system using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's guidelines., RESULTS: During an 8-month surveillance time period, 168 clusters were detected, 45 of which met criteria for investigation, and 6 were considered transmission events. The system was felt to be flexible, timely, accepted by the department and hospital, useful, and sensitive, but it required significant resources and has a low positive predictive value., CONCLUSIONS: WHONET-SaTScan is a useful addition to a robust IPC program. Although the resources required were significant, this prospective, real-time cluster detection surveillance system represents an improvement over historical methods. We detected several episodes of transmission which would have eluded us previously, and allowed us to focus infection prevention efforts and improve patient safety.

  abstract = {To guide One Health capacity building efforts in the Republic of Guinea in the wake of the 2014-2016 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak, we sought to identify and assess the existing systems and structures for zoonotic disease detection and control. We partnered with the government ministries responsible for human, animal, and environmental health to identify a list of zoonotic diseases - rabies, anthrax, brucellosis, viral hemorrhagic fevers, trypanosomiasis and highly pathogenic avian influenza - as the country's top priorities. We used each priority disease as a case study to identify existing processes for prevention, surveillance, diagnosis, laboratory confirmation, reporting and response across the three ministries. Results were used to produce disease-specific systems "maps" emphasizing linkages across the systems, as well as opportunities for improvement. We identified brucellosis as a particularly neglected condition. Past efforts to build avian influenza capabilities, which had degraded substantially in less than a decade, highlighted the challenge of sustainability. We observed a keen interest across sectors to reinvigorate national rabies control, and given the regional and global support for One Health approaches to rabies elimination, rabies could serve as an ideal disease to test incipient One Health coordination mechanisms and procedures. Overall, we identified five major categories of gaps and challenges: (1) Coordination; (2) Training; (3) Infrastructure; (4) Public Awareness; and (5) Research. We developed and prioritized recommendations to address the gaps, estimated the level of resource investment needed, and estimated a timeline for implementation. These prioritized recommendations can be used by the Government of Guinea to plan strategically for future One Health efforts, ideally under the auspices of the national One Health Platform. This work demonstrates an effective methodology for mapping systems and structures for zoonotic diseases, and the benefit of conducting a baseline review of systemic capabilities prior to embarking on capacity building efforts.Copyright {\copyright} 2019},

Information was extracted from documents and websites, and informal interviews were conducted with technical experts and stakeholders. The systems covered a broad range of objectives, used variable approaches and operated at very different scales and budgets. There was a high level of awareness and involvement by the industry.

  abstract = {Since the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, many state and local health departments around the United States have started to develop syndromic surveillance systems. Syndromic surveillance-a new concept in epidemiology-is the statistical analyses of data on individuals seeking care in emergency rooms (ER) or other health care settings with preidentified sets of symptoms thought to be related to the precursors of diseases. Making use of existing health care or other data, often already in electronic form, these systems are intended to give early warnings of bioterrorist attacks or other emerging health conditions. By focusing on symptoms rather than confirmed diagnoses, syndromic surveillance aims to detect bioevents earlier than would be possible with traditional surveillance systems. Because potential bioterrorist agents such as anthrax, plague, brucellosis, tularemia, Q-fever, glanders, smallpox, and viral hemorrhagic fevers initially exhibit symptoms ("present" in medical terminology) of a flulike illness, data suggesting a sudden increase of individuals with fever, headache, muscle pain, and malaise might be the first indication of a bioterrorist attack or natural disease outbreak. Syndromic surveillance is also thought to be useful for early detection of natural disease outbreaks [Hen04]. Research groups based at universities, health departments, private firms, and other organizations have proposed and are developing and promoting a variety of surveillance systems purported to meet public health needs. These include methods for analysis of data from healthcare facilities, as well as reports to health departments of unusual cases. Many of these methods involve intensive, automated statistical analysis of large amounts of data and intensive use of informatics techniques to gather data for analysis and to communicate among physicians and public health officials [WTE01]. Some of these systems go beyond health care data to include nonhealth data such as over-the-counter (OTC) pharmaceutical sales and absenteeism that might indicate people with symptoms who have not sought health care [Hen04]. There are a number of technological, logistical, and legal constraints to obtaining appropriate data and effective operation of syndromic surveillance systems [Bue04]. However, even with access to the requisite data and perfect organizational coordination and cooperation, the statistical challenges in reliably and accurately detecting a bioevent are formidable. The object of these surveillance systems, of course, is to analyze a stream of data in realtime and determine whether there is an anomaly suggesting that an incident has occurred. All data streams, however, have some degree of natural variability. These include seasonal or weekly patterns, a flu season that appears at a different time each winter or perhaps not at all, differences in coding practices, sales promotions for OTC medications, and random fluctuations due to small numbers of individuals with particular symptoms. Furthermore, for some natural outbreaks or bioterrorist attacks the "signal" (the number of additional cases over baseline rates) may be small compared to the "noise" (the random or systematic variation in the data). As a result, even the most effective statistical detection algorithms face a trade-off among three factors: sensitivity, false positives, and timeliness. The goals of this chapter are (1) to introduce the statistical issues in syndromic surveillance, (2) to describe and illustrate approaches to evaluating syndromic surveillance systems and characterizing their performance, and (3) to evaluate the performance of a couple of specific algorithms through both abstract simulations and simulations based on actual data. Section 1 of this chapter introduces and discusses the statistical concepts and issues in syndromic surveillance, illustrating them with data from an ER surveillance system from the District of Columbia. Section 2 presents methods from the statistical process control (SPC) literature, including variants on existing multivariate detection algorithms tailored to the syndromic surveillance problem, and compares and contrasts the performance of univariate and multivariate techniques via some abstract simulations. Section 3 then compares the new multivariate detection algorithms with commonly used approaches and illustrates the simulation approach to evaluation using simulations based on actual data from seven Washington, DC, hospital ERs. We conclude with a discussion about the implications for public health practice. {\copyright} 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

All patient records were retrospectively reviewed in depth by 2 infection control practitioners (ICPs) to determine which patients had suffered an HAI. Preventie van Ziekenhuisinfecties door Surveillance (PREZIES) criteria were used. Following this internal validation, 13 consecutive CAPPS were performed in a prospective study from January to March 2013 to determine weekly, monthly, and quarterly HAI point prevalence. Finally, a CAPPS was externally validated by PREZIES (Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu [RIVM], Bilthoven, Netherlands). In all evaluations, discrepancies were resolved by consensus. RESULTS In our series of CAPPS, 83\% of the patients were automatically excluded from detailed review by the ICP. The sensitivity of the method was 91\%. The time spent per hospital-wide CAPPS was {\textasciitilde}3 hours. External validation showed a negative predictive value of 99.1\% for CAPPS.

  abstract = {Objectives Our overall aim was to evaluate the Western Australian Intellectual Disability Exploring Answers (IDEA) surveillance system. The primary objective was to evaluate the attributes of the system. The secondary objective was to provide recommendations to data custodians and stakeholders to strengthen the system. Method The IDEA system was evaluated using process observation, interviews and secondary data analysis of system attributes: usefulness, simplicity, data quality, acceptability, representativeness, timeliness and stability. 2001 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines were used. Results We found that the IDEA system was useful, simple, flexible, acceptable, representative, timely and stable. We compared individuals from the IDEA system (n=10 593) with those with cerebral palsy and intellectual disability (ID) (n=582) from another surveillance system. Of the 582 with cerebral palsy and ID, 501 (86.1\%) were in the IDEA system and 81 (13.9\%) were not. In total, 0.7\% of cases (81/10674) with ID were not identified in the IDEA system. There were little differences in cases that were not identified in the IDEA system between Indigenous status, sex and place of residence. Conclusions The strengths of the IDEA system include having a high data quality resource contributing to national and international data on ID, strong government support and a dedicated management team. Output from studies linking to IDEA data have had major contributions to the international literature about ID. However, limited resources have prevented it from realising its full potential in relation to translational activities. The IDEA system is a valuable resource to address the needs of people living with ID.Copyright {\copyright} 2019 Author(s).},

Methods: The data and related reporting tables of HIV/AIDS were collected from national AIDS internet-based reporting system on 1 January 2010 to conduct analysis on accuracy, completeness and timeliness of case reporting. The evaluation and verification of AIDS prevention data were implemented in three stages of self evaluation at county level, provincial evaluation and national evaluation with the indicators of the qualified rate of reporting tables and rate of internet-based reporting. Results: Of the case reported in 2009, 63.3\% were reported by CDCs at all levels of which 68.9\% were reported by CDCs at county level. The errors in report card filling were found in some cases. In some cards, the identification card number, telephone number and working unit were missed. Transmission route item was filled in all report cards, but 9.5\% of them were filled with "uncertain". Epidemiological surveys were conducted for 98.4\% of the cases and the data obtained were entered into the internet-based reporting. The survey was completed for 90.9\% of the cases. Up to 88.8\% of the cases were reported within 15 days after confirmation or diagnosis by Western blotting. The qualified rate of report cards and rate of internet-based reporting were 94.3\% and 99.3\% respectively at provincial level, and the qualified rate of report cards and rate of internet-based report were 98.9\% and 100.0\% respectively at national level. Conclusion: The timeliness of case reporting and rate of epidemiological survey in 2009 were much higher than those in 2006, 2007 and 2008. The evaluation indicated that the quality of data reporting was good, but it is still necessary to improve the internet-based reporting of HIV/AIDS.},

Created in 2009, UNICEF's Nutrition Dashboard (NutriDash) collects nutrition programme information from 125 countries. An in-depth review of NutriDash was conducted to understand its strengths and identify key actions to increase its effectiveness and efficiency., METHODS: Adapting the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention updated guidelines for evaluating public health surveillance systems, a mixed-methods approach was used. A questionnaire was designed to capture information on key attributes of NutriDash and disseminated to UNICEF country offices for quantitative feedback on user experiences. Structured key informant interviews were held with internal and external stakeholders to gain qualitative perceptions on data generated from NutriDash. Analysis involved producing frequency distributions for the questionnaire data and performing thematic analyses on interview data., RESULTS: A total of 53 respondents completed the questionnaire (42\% response rate), representing 48 countries and good regional geographic representation. Most respondents (96\%) worked in UNICEF country offices. The percentages of participants who agreed or strongly agreed with each attribute of the NutriDash system were as follows: acceptability: 71\%, stability: 68\%, simplicity; 63\%, data quality: 60\%, flexibility: 58\% and usefulness: 43\%. Internal and external stakeholders commented on the value of NutriDash; its use ranging from nutrition global trend monitoring for programme planning to producing reports and dashboards. Key themes derived from this review as areas for improvement included communication, access to data and data quality., CONCLUSIONS: This review has identified key themes that will inform improvements to NutriDash and form a baseline for future periodic reviews to continuously enhance the system to improve availability of timely quality nutrition programme data. UNICEF will continue to engage with countries, key partners and governments to improve the NutriDash data value chain and ensure the right to nutrition for every child.

We calculated the age-specific incidence of MRSA patients using data from the Japan Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (JANIS) programme, which is based on sentinel surveillance systems, and inpatient HICs submitted to employee health insurance organizations in 2011, and then computed age-specific incidence ratios between the HIC and JANIS data. Age-specific MRSA incidence in both datasets followed J-shaped curves with similar shapes. For all age groups, the ratios between HIC and JANIS data were around 10. These findings indicate that JANIS notification of MRSA cases was not affected by patients' age.},

The completeness of the case report forms filed at the Primary Units of Data Generation (PUDG) were evaluated, as well as the accuracy and suitability of the tests (PPV: positive predictive value). The average time-lags between each step were then calculated., RESULTS: There were 7.3, 12.38, 4.66, 6.25 and 29.9 annual cases of dengue infection per 10 000 inhabitants in 2009 to 2013, respectively. In this study, only 57.76\% of the cases were classified correctly by the physicians and 26.32\% of them were questioned about their home conditions and whether their family/friends had similar symptoms. Patients visited a clinic/hospital on average 4.76 days after developing symptoms and the health system was notified on average 1.75 days later, while 70.6\% of them were reported within the one-day target period. There were only minor changes in case reporting times even during a DENV epidemic. Some (12.85\%) of the case forms were later modified (average 16.7 days). In the period 2009-2013, the IgM confirmed PPV was 58.60\%, while 20 mandatory criteria were absent on more than 25\% of the forms., CONCLUSIONS: The system was accurate, simple, flexible, stable and acceptable, but a number of ways are suggested to improve this case detection and reporting system.},

  abstract = {Although international health agencies encourage the development of One Health (OH) surveillance, many systems remain mostly compartmentalized, with limited collaborations among sectors and disciplines. In the framework of the OH European Joint Programme "MATRIX" project, a generic evaluation tool called OH-EpiCap has been developed to enable individual institutes/governments to characterize, assess and monitor their own OH epidemiological surveillance capacities and capabilities. The tool is organized around three dimensions: organization, operational activities, and impact of the OH surveillance system; each dimension is then divided into four targets, each including four indicators. A semi-quantitative questionnaire enables the scoring of each indicator, with four levels according to the degree of satisfaction in the studied OH surveillance system. The evaluation is conducted by a panel of surveillance representatives (during a half-day workshop or with a back-and-forth process to reach a consensus). An R Shiny-based web application facilitates implementation of the evaluation and visualization of the results, and includes a benchmarking option. The tool was piloted on several foodborne hazards (i.e., Salmonella, Campylobacter, Listeria), emerging threats (e.g., antimicrobial resistance) and other zoonotic hazards (psittacosis) in multiple European countries in 2022. These case studies showed that the OH-EpiCap tool supports the tracing of strengths and weaknesses in epidemiological capacities and the identification of concrete and direct actions to improve collaborative activities at all steps of surveillance. It appears complementary to the existing EU-LabCap tool, designed to assess the capacity and capability of European microbiology laboratories. In addition, it provides opportunity to reinforce trust between surveillance stakeholders from across the system and to build a good foundation for a professional network for further collaboration.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance has reached globally alarming levels and is becoming a major public health threat. Lack of efficacious antimicrobial resistance surveillance systems was identified as one of the causes of increasing resistance, due to the lag time between new resistances and alerts to care providers. Several initiatives to track drug resistance evolution have been developed. However, no effective real-time and source-independent antimicrobial resistance monitoring system is available publicly., OBJECTIVE: To design and implement an architecture that can provide real-time and source-independent antimicrobial resistance monitoring to support transnational resistance surveillance. In particular, we investigated the use of a Semantic Web-based model to foster integration and interoperability of interinstitutional and cross-border microbiology laboratory databases., METHODS: Following the agile software development methodology, we derived the main requirements needed for effective antimicrobial resistance monitoring, from which we proposed a decentralized monitoring architecture based on the Semantic Web stack. The architecture uses an ontology-driven approach to promote the integration of a network of sentinel hospitals or laboratories. Local databases are wrapped into semantic data repositories that automatically expose local computing-formalized laboratory information in the Web. A central source mediator, based on local reasoning, coordinates the access to the semantic end points. On the user side, a user-friendly Web interface provides access and graphical visualization to the integrated views., RESULTS: We designed and implemented the online Antimicrobial Resistance Trend Monitoring System (ARTEMIS) in a pilot network of seven European health care institutions sharing 70+ million triples of information about drug resistance and consumption. Evaluation of the computing performance of the mediator demonstrated that, on average, query response time was a few seconds (mean 4.3, SD 0.1 x 10(2) seconds). Clinical pertinence assessment showed that resistance trends automatically calculated by ARTEMIS had a strong positive correlation with the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net) (rho = .86, P {$<$} .001) and the Sentinel Surveillance of Antibiotic Resistance in Switzerland (SEARCH) (rho = .84, P {$<$} .001) systems. Furthermore, mean resistance rates extracted by ARTEMIS were not significantly different from those of either EARS-Net ( = +/-0.130; 95\% confidence interval -0 to 0.030; P {$<$} .001) or SEARCH ( = +/-0.042; 95\% confidence interval -0.004 to 0.028; P = .004)., CONCLUSIONS: We introduce a distributed monitoring architecture that can be used to build transnational antimicrobial resistance surveillance networks. Results indicated that the Semantic Web-based approach provided an efficient and reliable solution for development of eHealth architectures that enable online antimicrobial resistance monitoring from heterogeneous data sources. In future, we expect that more health care institutions can join the ARTEMIS network so that it can provide a large European and wider biosurveillance network that can be used to detect emerging bacterial resistance in a multinational context and support public health actions.}

  abstract = {Epidemiological surveillance is the systematic collection, analysis and dissemination of health data for the planning, implementation and evaluation of public health programmes. Established surveillance systems should be regularly reviewed on the basis of explicit criteria of usefulness, cost and quality; systems should be modified as a result of such review. Attributes of quality include: (i) sensitivity, (ii) specificity, (iii) representativeness, (iv) timeliness, (v) simplicity, (vi) flexibility and (vii) acceptability. To date, evaluation of surveillance systems has been limited in scope and content. The evaluation method proposed in this article offers an organized approach to the evaluation of epidemiological surveillance systems. The usefulness of a surveillance system is measured by whether it leads to prevention or control or a better understanding of adverse health events. The measure can be qualitative, in terms of the subjective views of those using the system, or quantitative in terms of the impact of surveillance data on policies, interventions or the occurrence of a health event. The cost of a system includes indirect as well as direct costs, and should be measured in relation to the benefits obtained, such as reduction of medical-care expenses and of time lost from work. All elements of the system should be included in the cost: data collection, analysis and dissemination. The sensitivity of a surveillance system is its ability to detect health events (completeness of reporting). Its specificity is inversely proportional to the number of false positives it reports. Reports of a disease that do not meet the case definition are false positives, and may result in resources being wasted in investigating them. However, in circumstances where it is extremely important not to miss a single true case, a certain level of false positives may be acceptable. Representativeness can be measured by comparing surveillance data covering part of the population to either nationwide data, where available, or to random sample-survey data. A source may be representative for one particular disease or condition but not for another. Representativeness involves such factors as age, sex, ethnic group, socioeconomic status and residence. Timeliness involves not only the interval between the occurrence of the event and the receipt of the report at the health agency, but also the time subsequently required for identifying a problem or epidemic and the initiation of control measures. Timeliness is relative to the event concerned; for example, for most infectious diseases, the response should be made in a matter of days, whereas for cancer surveillance annual reporting may be adequate. Simplicity in a system means it is easy to understand and implement, and is therefore usually relatively cheap and flexible. A flexible system is easily adapted by adding new notifiable diseases or conditions or extending it to additional population groups. However, care should be taken that the reporting burden is not thereby increased to an unacceptable level, leading to loss of data quality or timeliness. The acceptability of a system depends on the perceived public health importance of the event under surveillance, recognition of the contribution of individuals to the system, and the time required to make the reports. The surveillance method must be acceptable not only to the collectors of the data, for the reasons just mentioned, but also to the providers (both ill and well persons) in terms of confidentiality and cultural sensitivities. Thus, acceptability can be measured by the proportion of persons asked who actually complete a questionnaire. The attributes of surveillance discussed are interdependent. Increasing the sensitivity of a system to detect a greater proportion of a health event may improve representativeness and usefulness, but also increase the cost and lead to the reporting of more false positives. Paradoxically, the less frequent the event, the more expensive it may be to keep under surveillance. It is also necessary to bear in mind that changes in representativeness or sensitivity can occur with time and lead to misinterpretation of the data, such as when improved diagnostic facilities lead to increased case reporting. Quality control of the system should go beyond spot checking of questionnaire completeness to periodic checking against the source data. Evaluation of surveillance systems is an essential prerequisite to improving their efficiency and effectiveness.},

  abstract = {Objective: Evaluating public health surveillance systems is critical to ensuring that conditions of public health importance are appropriately monitored. Our objectives were to qualitatively evaluate 6 state and local health departments that were early adopters of syndromic surveillance in order to (1) understand the characteristics and current uses, (2) identify the most and least useful syndromes to monitor, (3) gauge the utility for early warning and outbreak detection, and (4) assess how syndromic surveillance impacted their daily decision making. Design: We adapted evaluation guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and gathered input from CDC subject matter experts in public health surveillance to develop a questionnaire. Participants: We interviewed staff members from a convenience sample of 6 local and state health departments with syndromic surveillance programs that had been in operation for {$>$}10 years. Results: Three of the 6 interviewees provided an example of using syndromic surveillance to identify an outbreak (ie, cluster of foodborne illness in 1 jurisdiction) or detect a surge in cases for seasonal conditions (eg, influenza in 2 jurisdictions) prior to traditional, disease-specific systems. Although all interviewees noted that syndromic surveillance has not been routinely useful or efficient for early outbreak detection or case finding in their jurisdictions, all agreed that the information can be used to improve their understanding of dynamic disease control environments and conditions (eg, situational awareness) in their communities. Conclusion: In the jurisdictions studied, syndromic surveillance may be useful for monitoring the spread and intensity of large outbreaks of disease, especially influenza; enhancing public health awareness of mass gatherings and natural disasters; and assessing new, otherwise unmonitored conditions when real-time alternatives are unavailable. Future studies should explore opportunities to strengthen syndromic surveillance by including broader access to and enhanced analysis of text-related data from electronic health records.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: As we move toward a polio-free world, the challenge for the polio program is to create an unrelenting focus on smaller areas where the virus is still present, where children are being repeatedly missed, where immunity levels are low, and where surveillance is weak., OBJECTIVE: This article aimed to describe a possible solution to address weak surveillance systems and document the outcomes of the deployment of the Auto-Visual Acute Flaccid Paralysis Detection and Reporting (AVADAR) project., METHODS: This intervention was implemented in 99 targeted high-risk districts with concerns for silent polio circulation from eight countries in Africa between August 1, 2017, and July 31, 2018. A total of 6954 persons (5390 community informants and 1564 health workers) were trained and equipped with a smartphone on which the AVADAR app was configured to allow community informants to send alerts on suspected acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) and allow health worker to use electronic checklists for investigation of such alerts. The AVADAR and Open Data Kit ONA servers were at the center of the entire process. A dashboard system and coordination teams for monitoring and supervision were put in place at all levels., RESULTS: Overall, 96.44\% (24,142/25,032) of potential AFP case alerts were investigated by surveillance personnel, yielding 1414 true AFP cases. This number (n=1414) reported through AVADAR was higher than the 238 AFP cases expected during the study period in the AVADAR districts and the 491 true AFP cases reported by the traditional surveillance system. A total of 203 out of the 1414 true AFP cases reported were from special population settings, such as refugee camps and insecure areas. There was an improvement in reporting in silent health areas in all the countries using the AVADAR system. Finally, there were 23,473 reports for other diseases, such as measles, diarrhea, and cerebrospinal meningitis, using the AVADAR platform., CONCLUSIONS: This article demonstrates the added value of AVADAR to rapidly improve surveillance sensitivity. AVADAR is capable of supporting countries to improve surveillance sensitivity within a short interval before and beyond polio-free certification.

  abstract = {Background The National Vector Borne Disease Control Program (NVBDCP) was launched in 2003-04 as an umbrella program for preventing and controlling vector-borne diseases, which includes malaria, filariasis, and kala-azar, dengue, and chikungunya [1]. Kala-azar or visceral leishmaniasis was targeted for elimination by the year 2020. However, 54 districts in India are endemic for the disease, of which 33 belong to Bihar state. Eighty-six percentage of 485 affected blocks (administrative subunits of the district) of Bihar have achieved elimination [2]. Studying the surveillance for kalaazar in Bihar will help to understand the progress and the difficulties faced in the path to the elimination of the disease. Methods We assessed the kala-azar surveillance system in the Khagaria district of Bihar for strengths and weaknesses and proposed recommendations for improvement. Two blocks of Khagaria, Alauli, and Parbatta, with the highest and lowest number of kala-azar cases, respectively, were included in the assessment. We used the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for evaluating specific attributes of the public health surveillance system [3]. With a focus on 2015-2018, we interviewed the District Vector Borne Disease Control Officer, District Vector Borne Disease Consultant, four Medical Officers (MO), two kala-azar Technical Supervisors (KTS), eight private practitioners (PP), four Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANM) and eleven Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA) regarding the simplicity of the case definition and the flexibility in reporting. We reviewed diagnostic methods for flexibility, block line lists for both data quality and flexibility, and district and block monthly reports for completeness and timeliness. We assessed the acceptability component by reviewing the training and engagement of the MOs, KTSs, ANMs, and ASHAs at the task force and stakeholder meetings. The proportion of cases reported by the health facilities and the proportion of private health facilities reporting cases were used to evaluate the representativeness. We evaluated the programme's stability by calculating the proportion of filled human resource vacancies in the program. For usefulness, we analyzed monthly disease trends at the block level. Results Overall, 34.5\% (10 of 29) of the staff interviewed were aware of the case definition (Table 1). Different methods for reporting the cases were indicated by the ASHAs, demonstrating flexibility in the system. As additional evidence of flexibility, fields were modified or added to the line list to adapt to evolving needs, such as a diagnostic method change. We found the monthly district report was complete for 2015 - 2017; however, block line lists had 431 blank fields out of 1390 (31\%).We identified that, in 2015, only 58\% (14/24) of the block reports were submitted, which increased to 79\% in 2016 \& 2017. Only 66\% (2/3) of the district reports were presented on time from 2015 to 2017. Medical Officers \& KTSs were trained at the national \& state level, respectively, and considered acceptable. However, from January to July 2018, the District Task Force meeting frequency was low (1/7,14\%). The meeting frequency was better at the block level (10/14, 71\%). In 2018, there was documented discussion of kala-azar one time each at ANM (1/26, 3.8\%) and ASHA (1/27, 3.7\%) meetings at the block level. We could not assess representativeness because there were insufficient data to determine which entities reported cases and to determine denominators for those calculations. There were no human resource vacancies, as all sanctioned posts for kala-azar surveillance had been filled. The Khagaria district showed a progressive decline in reported cases: from 131 in 2015 to 63 in 2017. All blocks within Khagaria achieved elimination status in 2016. Conclusions The kala-azar surveillance system in Khagaria is flexible, stable, acceptable, and useful. It is simple for MOs and KTSs, but not for ANMs and ASHAs. However, there is a need to improve data quality (particularly at the block level) to make the system simpler for ANMs and ASHAs. Discussions at district and block level meetings of the stakeholders and the health staff should improve. It would be beneficial to have a listing of private health facilities to further act upon and ensure their surveillance involvement.},

  abstract = {During the West African Ebola virus disease outbreak in 2014-15, health agencies had severe challenges with case notification and contact tracing. To overcome these, we developed the Surveillance, Outbreak Response Management and Analysis System (SORMAS). The objective of this study was to measure perceived quality of SORMAS and its change over time. We ran a 4-week-pilot and 8-week-implementation of SORMAS among hospital informants in Kano state, Nigeria in 2015 and 2018 respectively. We carried out surveys after the pilot and implementation asking about usefulness and acceptability. We calculated the proportions of users per answer together with their 95\% confidence intervals (CI) and compared whether the 2015 response distributions differed from those from 2018. Total of 31 and 74 hospital informants participated in the survey in 2015 and 2018, respectively. In 2018, 94\% (CI: 89-100\%) of users indicated that the tool was useful, 92\% (CI: 86-98\%) would recommend SORMAS to colleagues and 18\% (CI: 10-28\%) had login difficulties. In 2015, the proportions were 74\% (CI: 59-90\%), 90\% (CI: 80-100\%), and 87\% (CI: 75-99\%) respectively. Results indicate high usefulness and acceptability of SORMAS. We recommend mHealth tools to be evaluated to allow repeated measurements and comparisons between different versions and users.},

  abstract = {Rationale: As industries and technologies continue to evolve, identifying novel occupational lung diseases remains an import aspect of occupational safety and health. Recognizing preventable and novel sentinel occupational lung diseases provides warning signals to occupational health professionals that can lead to new worker safety research and recommendations. No systematic Federal notification system exists to identify novel occupational lung diseases. The Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Act of 1970 authorizes the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to respond to written requests from three employees, management, or a union representative to provide the service of performing worksite hazard evaluations through the Health Hazard Evaluation (HHE) Program. We aimed to determine if the HHE Program could also serve as a sentinel surveillance system to identify or characterize novel occupational lung diseases. Method(s): Using the methods and criteria outlined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's guidelines for evaluating a public health surveillance system to the extent possible, the HHE program was evaluated as a sentinel surveillance system for novel occupational lung diseases. Through stakeholder interviews, the HHE program was assessed for simplicity, flexibility, data quality, acceptability, sensitivity, predictive value positive, representativeness, timeliness, and stability. These criteria were judged using a scoring system of 1 to 4 representing the perceived effectiveness of the HHE Program as a surveillance system. Result(s): The NIOSH HHE Program has used field investigations to characterize several newly recognized occupational lung diseases including obliterative bronchiolitis in microwave popcorn, flavoring, and coffee workers; flock interstitial lung disease in flock manufacturing workers; and hypersensitivity pneumonitis in workers exposed to metalworking fluids. The HHE Program's strengths include data quality, predictive value positive, and stability (Table). Sensitivity and representativeness require the most development for the HHE Program to function as a sentinel surveillance system. Conclusion(s): In addition to the HHE Program's primary role as a service, with its high data quality, strong predictive value positive, and stability, it could also function as a sentinel surveillance system to identify novel occupational lung diseases. However, the sensitivity and representativeness of the HHE Program is limited by low worker and employer awareness of the Program and perceived negative consequences to making an HHE request. Improving employer, employee, and health care provider awareness about the HHE Program's benefits would enhance the program's sensitivity and representativeness as a surveillance system for novel occupational lung diseases; however, additional resources could be required to investigate additional requests.

The aim of this study was to evaluate timeliness, data quality and representativeness of data reported to the Italian Integrated Epidemiological System for Acute Viral Hepatitis (SEIEVA)., STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of surveillance data., METHODS: Quantitative indicators were used to evaluate representativeness of reported cases, data quality, and timeliness between surveillance steps, for reports of acute viral hepatitis cases with date of onset of symptoms from 2009 to 2012 (N = 4516)., RESULTS: Representativeness was 75\%. Over 95\% of records reported information on age, sex, city of residence, risk factors for hepatitis A and vaccination status. Information on risk factors for hepatitis B and C were reported less consistently (83\%), as was information on early outcome (60\%). Wide delays were found between surveillance steps., CONCLUSIONS: The system collects high quality data on acute viral hepatitis cases in Italy. Timeliness was found to be the main limit and needs to be improved by optimizing web-based reporting procedures, increasing communication with participating centres, improving feedback and increasing dissemination of surveillance results. The study highlights the importance of reporting timeliness to detect outbreaks of acute viral hepatitis. Copyright {\copyright} 2015 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Despite significant advances in improving the predictive models for vector-borne diseases, only a few countries have integrated an early warning system (EWS) with predictive and response capabilities into their disease surveillance systems. The limited understanding of forecast performance and uncertainties by decision-makers is one of the primary factors that precludes its operationalization in preparedness and response planning. Further, predictive models exhibit a decrease in forecast skill with longer lead times, a trade-off between forecast accuracy and timeliness and effectiveness of action. This study presents a methodological framework to evaluate the economic value of EWS-triggered responses from the health system perspective. Assuming an operational EWS in place, the framework makes explicit the trade-offs between forecast accuracy, timeliness of action, effectiveness of response, and costs, and uses the net benefit analysis, which measures the benefits of taking action minus the associated costs. Uncertainty in disease forecasts and other parameters is accounted for through probabilistic sensitivity analysis. The output is the probability distribution of the net benefit estimates at given forecast lead times. A non-negative net benefit and the probability of yielding such are considered a general signal that the EWS-triggered response at a given lead time is economically viable. In summary, the proposed framework translates uncertainties associated with disease forecasts and other parameters into decision uncertainty by quantifying the economic risk associated with operational response to vector-borne disease events of potential importance predicted by an EWS. The goal is to facilitate a more informed and transparent public health decision-making under uncertainty.},

METHOD(S): All 1995 hospital billing records with a discharge diagnosis code of TB (ICD- 9 CM 010-018) were retrieved and matched to Wisconsin TB registry records. A hospital discharge summary was obtained for persons not in the registry to verify the TB diagnosis. A list of persons with specimens from which Mycobacterium tuberculosis was isolated in 1995 was requested from all Wisconsin and pertinent out-of-state laboratories and compared with the TB registry. RESULT(S): Of the 88 TB cases identified from laboratory lists, one (1.1\%) was unreported. Of the 51 TB cases identified from hospital discharge records, one (2.0\%) was unreported. The positive predictive values of laboratory and hospital discharge data for a verified TB case were 98.9\% and 38.3\%, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): In Wisconsin during 1995, nearly all TB cases among hospitalized persons or persons from whom M. tuberculosis was isolated were reported. Most persons having a TB diagnosis code did not have TB.},

  abstract = {Background: Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is critical to reducing its wide-reaching impact. Its reliance on sample size invites solutions to longstanding constraints regarding scalability. A robotic platform (RASP) was developed for high-throughput AMR surveillance in accordance with internationally recognized standards (CLSI and ISO 20776-1:2019) and validated through a series of experiments. Methods: Experiment A compared RASP's ability to achieve consistent MICs with that of a human technician across eight replicates for four Escherichia coli isolates. Experiment B assessed RASP's agreement with human-performed MICs across 91 E. coli isolates with a diverse range of AMR profiles. Additionally, to demonstrate its real-world applicability, the RASP workflow was then applied to five faecal samples where a minimum of 47 E. coli per animal (239 total) were evaluated using an AMR indexing framework. Results: For each drug-rater-isolate combination in Experiment A, there was a clear consensus of the MIC and deviation from the consensus remained within one doubling dilution (the exception being gentamicin at two dilutions). Experiment B revealed a concordance correlation coefficient of 0.9670 (95\% CI: 0.9670-0.9670) between the robot- and human-performed MICs. RASP's application to the five faecal samples highlighted the intra-animal diversity of gut commensal E. coli, identifying between five and nine unique isolate AMR phenotypes per sample. Conclusions: While adhering to internationally accepted guidelines, RASP was superior in throughput, cost and data resolution when compared with an experienced human technician. Integration of robotics platforms in the microbiology laboratory is a necessary advancement for future One Health AMR endeavours.},

Methods: The reported data of vaccination rate was used to analyze vaccination rate, difference (D) and ratio (R) for the evaluation of the routine immunization coverage in Jiujiang. Results: The reported vaccination rates of vaccines included in routine immunization were all more than 98\%, and the estimated vaccination rates varied from 77.24\%-104.27\%, with low rates of DT and MenAC. The evaluation of D values between reported rates and estimated ones indicated that the data were reliable except those of DT and MenAC (unreliable) and MMR in 2011 (doubtful). The analysis of R values showed that the relatively larger targeted children population of HepB and BCG vaccination indicated that the data of HepB and BCG vaccination were less reliable than other vaccines. Conclusion: The monitoring data quality of routine immunization coverage was generally good. The vaccination rates of most routine immunization vaccines were kept at a high level while the rates of 'booster' vaccination should be further increased. In order to improve the routine immunization coverage, every county and district should accurately monitor the birth and target population.},

Measles and rubella case reports were extracted from IMRSS. We estimated system sensitivity at the level of case reporting, using the capture-recapture method for three data sources. Data quality was described as the completeness of variables and timeliness of notification as the median-time interval from symptoms onset to initial alert. The proportion of suspected cases with laboratory investigation, the rate of discarded cases and the origin of infection were also computed. A total of 127 measles and four rubella suspected cases were reported to IMRSS and 82 were laboratory confirmed. Focusing our analysis on measles, IMRSS sensitivity was 82\% (95\% CI: 75-87). Completeness was {$>$}98\% for mandatory variables and 57\% for 'genotyping'. The median-time interval from symptoms onset to initial alert was 4.5 days, with a timeliness of notification of 33\% (41 cases reported 48 h). The proportion of laboratory investigation was 87\%. The rate of discarded cases was 0.1 per 100 000 inhabitants per year. The origin of infection was identified for 85\% of cases. It is concluded that IMRSS provides good quality data and has good sensitivity; still efforts should be made to improve the completeness of laboratory-related variables, timeliness and to increase the rate of discarded cases.},

The coordination of sentinel general practices can, however, be time consuming and expensive. For the last two influenza seasons we have used a deputising medical locum service as a sentinel site for influenza surveillance. We are not aware of such a service being used as a sentinel site elsewhere in the world. In both retrospective and prospective comparisons, we have shown that ILI surveillance patterns from sentinel general practices are very similar to those from the locum service. Because of its timeliness, flexibility, patient mix and geographic spread, locum service surveillance is able to supplement sentinel ILI surveillance and may also have a role in the recognition of emerging disease patterns. This is likely to be true not only in Australia but also in countries of the European Union.},

  abstract = {Insufficient data from existing surveillance systems underlie societal tolerance of acute and slow-onset health disasters that threaten, harm, and kill vast numbers of humans, animals, and plants. Here we describe barriers to integrated "One Health" surveillance, including those related to a lack of medical services, professional divisions, incompatible vocabularies, isolated data sets, and territorial borders. We draw from publications of experts who justify broader and more integrated surveillance, education, and stewardship focused on preventing and mitigating disease emergence and re-emergence. In addition, we highlight efforts from Illinois, the United States and the broader world, pointing to examples of relevant education; ways to acquire, compile, and analyze diagnostic and syndromic data; mapping of diseases of humans and animals; and rapid communication of findings and recommendations. For the future, we propose using needed outcomes for health and sustainability to set priorities for One Health programs of education, surveillance, and stewardship. Professionals and paraprofessionals should gather, interpret, and widely communicate the implications of data, not only on infectious diseases, but also on toxic agents, malnutrition, ecological damage, the grave impacts of warfare, societal drivers underlying these problems, and the effectiveness of specific countermeasures.},

  abstract = {Presenter: Naeem Ud Din, Veterinary Officer, Directorate General (Extension), Livestock \& Dairy Development Department, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Peshawar, Pakistan Background: In February 2006 avian influenza virus subtype H5N1 was found for the first time in two isolated commercial poultry flocks in northern Pakistan. The areas most affected by highly pathogenic avian influenza included areas in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa during 2006-2008. The surveillance system for avian influenza virus in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa monitors the pathogens circulating in the area, adopts control strategies in case of any emergency and maintains continuous surveillance in the field to prevent any disease outbreak. Purpose(s): The objective of this study was to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the avian influenza surveillance system in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and to formulate recommendations for its improvement. Methodology: The surveillance system for avian influenza in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was evaluated using the Updated guidelines for evaluating public health surveillance systems (2001) of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The surveillance system (2012-2013) was evaluated in March 2014. Finding(s): The surveillance system was very well implemented because of its simplicity and flexibility. Data quality was good until 2013. However, after that, data quality was adversely affected when computerization of data was not done. The system is well accepted by partners and technical field staff. Because of the absence of any cases since 2009, the sensitivity and positive predictive value were not measured. However, samples collected represented all type of birds and farms and were good, representative samples. Usually it took 14 days for the samples collected to reach national reference laboratories for investigation, which indicates poor timelines. Projects and funding have been closed by donors and the federal government since 2009 when avian influenza was officially declared controlled and no further case was detected through active surveillance. However, the provincial government funds the system to meet a minimum level of surveillance. Conclusion(s): Overall the system is operating well. It is recommended that field and veterinary staff are trained to improve the quality of the data collected. The reporting time should be decreased to 7 days for timely detection of and response to potential outbreaks.

  abstract = {Background: Crimean Congo Haemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) is an acute viral zoonotic disease that is endemic in Pakistan. Poverty, limited awareness and lack of biosafety practices make it a potential occupational health risk. A poor surveillance system makes it more difficult to monitor the disease burden. Purpose: An evaluation was carried out to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the event-based CCHF surveillance system in Balochistan, Pakistan, and to propose recommendations for improvement. Methods: A descriptive evaluation study was conducted at an isolation ward of a public hospital from November 2017 to February 2018 in Balochistan Province. Event-based CCHF surveillance system was evaluated by using updated CDC guidelines for Evaluating Public Health Surveillance Systems. Data were collected through review of records and interaction with stakeholders. Using a semi-structured questionnaire, surveillance system attributes were assessed according to the guidelines in the study tool. Findings: The system was simple, but had no standardised case definition. It was found to be flexible as new health-related events could be easily incorporated. Data quality was moderate; 80\% (75/94) of the reports were completely filled. The system had good timeliness but lacked involvement of the private sector. Acceptability was good with involvement of different government stakeholders. Sensitivity was poor while positive predictive value was 27.5\%. Conclusion: Event based surveillance for CCHF can be improved by involvement of private practitioners and laboratories in the surveillance system to improve representativeness. The timeliness could be improved by adopting an online reporting mechanism. Feedback, support and supervision should be ensured for data quality assurance. Periodic refresher trainings of the staff could be organized. {\copyright} 2019 The Author(s).},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 has caused a pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) which has spread exponentially worldwide. A robust surveillance system is essential for correct estimation of the disease burden and containment of the pandemic. We evaluated the performance of COVID-19 case-based surveillance system in FCT, Nigeria and assessed its key attributes., METHODS: We used a cross-sectional study design, comprising a survey, key informant interview, record review and secondary data analysis. A self-administered, semi-structured questionnaire was administered to key stakeholders to assess the attributes and process of operation of the surveillance system using CDC's Updated Guidelines for Evaluation of Public Health Surveillance System 2001. Data collected alongside surveillance data from March 2020 to January 2021 were analyzed and summarized using descriptive statistics., RESULTS: Out of 69,338 suspected cases, 12,595 tested positive with RT-PCR with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 18\%. Healthcare workers were identified as high-risk group with a prevalence of 23.5\%. About 82\% respondents perceived the system to be simple, 85.5\% posited that the system was flexible and easily accommodates changes, 71.4\% reported that the system was acceptable and expressed willingness to continue participation. Representativeness of the system was 93\%, stability 40\%, data quality 56.2\% and timeliness 45.5\%, estimated result turnaround time (TAT) was suboptimal., CONCLUSION: The system was found to be useful, simple, flexible, sensitive, acceptable, with good representativeness but the stability, data quality and timeliness was poor. The system meets initial surveillance objectives but rapid expansion of sample collection and testing sites, improvement of TAT, sustainable funding, improvement of electronic database, continuous provision of logistics, supplies and additional trainings are needed to address identified weaknesses, optimize the system performance and meet increasing need of case detection in the wake of rapidly spreading pandemic. More risk-group persons should be tested to improve surveillance effectiveness.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Following an influx of an estimated 742,000 Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) established an active indicator-based Community Based Surveillance (CBS) in 13 sub-camps in Cox's Bazar in August 2017. Its objective was to detect epidemic prone diseases early for rapid response. We describe the surveillance, alert and response in place from epidemiological week 20 (12 May 2019) until 44 (2 November 2019)., METHODS: Suspected cases were identified through passive health facility surveillance and active indicator-based CBS. CBS-teams conducted active case finding for suspected cases of acute watery diarrhea (AWD), acute jaundice syndrome (AJS), acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), dengue, diphtheria, measles and meningitis. We evaluate the following surveillance system attributes: usefulness, Positive Predictive Value (PPV), timeliness, simplicity, flexibility, acceptability, representativeness and stability., RESULTS: Between epidemiological weeks 20 and 44, an average of 97,340 households were included in the CBS per surveillance cycle. Household coverage reached over 85\%. Twenty-one RDT positive cholera cases and two clusters of AWD were identified by the CBS and health facility surveillance that triggered the response mechanism within 12 hours. The PPV of the CBS varied per disease between 41.7\%-100\%. The CBS required 354 full-time staff in 10 different roles. The CBS was sufficiently flexible to integrate dengue surveillance. The CBS was representative of the population in the catchment area due to its exhaustive character and high household coverage. All households consented to CBS participation, showing acceptability., DISCUSSION: The CBS allowed for timely response but was resource intensive. Disease trends identified by the health facility surveillance and suspected diseases trends identified by CBS were similar, which might indicate limited additional value of the CBS in a dense and stable setting such as Cox's Bazar. Instead, a passive community-event-based surveillance mechanism combined with health facility-based surveillance could be more appropriate.},

There is, however, an ongoing debate about the feasibility of syndromic surveillance and its potential added value. Here we present our perspective on syndromic surveillance, based on the results of a retrospective analysis of syndromic data from six Dutch healthcare registries, covering 1999-2009 or part of this period. These registries had been designed for other purposes, but were evaluated for their potential use in signalling infectious disease dynamics and outbreaks. Our results show that syndromic surveillance clearly has added value in revealing the blind spots of traditional surveillance, in particular by detecting unusual, local outbreaks independently of diagnoses of specific pathogens, and by monitoring disease burden and virulence shifts of common pathogens. Therefore we recommend the use of syndromic surveillance for these applications.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Up-to-date information on the occurrence of drug overdose is critical to guide public health response. The objective of our study was to evaluate a near-real-time fatal drug overdose surveillance system to improve timeliness of drug overdose monitoring. Method(s): We analyzed data on deaths in the King County (Washington) Medical Examiner's Office (KCMEO) jurisdiction that occurred during March 1, 2017-February 28, 2018, and that had routine toxicology test results. Medical examiners (MEs) classified probable drug overdoses on the basis of information obtained through the death investigation and autopsy. We calculated sensitivity, positive predictive value, specificity, and negative predictive value of MEs' classification by using the final death certificate as the gold standard. Result(s): KCMEO investigated 2480 deaths; 1389 underwent routine toxicology testing, and 361 were toxicologically confirmed drug overdoses from opioid, stimulant, or euphoric drugs. Sensitivity of the probable overdose classification was 83\%, positive predictive value was 89\%, specificity was 96\%, and negative predictive value was 94\%. Probable overdoses were classified a median of 1 day after the event, whereas the final death certificate confirming an overdose was received by KCMEO an average of 63 days after the event. Conclusion(s): King County MEs' probable overdose classification provides a near-real-time indicator of fatal drug overdoses, which can guide rapid local public health responses to the drug overdose epidemic.Copyright {\copyright} 2021, Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health.},

The livestock sector has some inherent vulnerabilities which put it at risk to the deliberate or accidental spread of disease. The growing concern of countries about the risks of agro-terrorism and agro-crime has led to efforts to prepare against potential attacks. One recent international effort is the launch of a joint OIE, FAO and INTERPOL project in 2019 to build resilience against agro-terrorism and agro-crime targeting animal health with the financial support of the Weapons Threat Reduction Programme of Global Affairs Canada. Given the importance of strong animal health surveillance systems for the early and effective response to agro-terrorism and agro-crime, the project will use the FAO Surveillance Evaluation Tool (SET) and its new Biothreat Detection Module to evaluate beneficiary countries' capacities to detect criminal or terrorist animal health events. This paper presents the development of the new SET Biothreat Detection Module and how it will be used to evaluate surveillance for agro-terrorism and agro-crime animal disease threats. The module will be piloted in early 2021 and, once finalized, will be used by beneficiary countries of the joint OIE-FAO-INTERPOL project. Results from evaluations using SET and its Biothreat Detection Module are expected to provide a baseline from which countries can build targeted capacity for animal disease surveillance including early detection and investigation of potential terrorist or criminal events involving zoonotic and non-zoonotic animal pathogens.

Fifty-nine recording systems were identified, of which 36 had their key characteristics defined through a web-based questionnaire. Nineteen of them were further assessed following the SERVAL, a SuRveillance EVALuation framework against a set of 12 attributes: benefit, bias, communication, coverage, data collection, data management, data analysis, data completeness, flexibility, multiple utility, representativeness and stability/sustainability. The evaluated systems showed considerable differences in their coverage, implementation and objectives. There were overlaps in recorded conditions, with Johne's disease, bovine viral diarrhoea, mastitis and lameness being recorded by most of the systems. Selection bias, data ownership and lack of integration of data from different systems appeared to be a key limitation on the future use of existing systems for nationwide monitoring. The results showed that even though the individual systems can provide reliable estimates of dairy health for individual farmers, none of the systems alone could provide accurate and reliable estimates for any of the conditions of interest at national level.

This information allowed us to assess usefulness and cost of the system, its applicability and the timeliness of information, according to the criteria of the Centers for Disease Control. The system is based on a standardized nominative form for the delivery of blood products and specific feedback. For the participants, traceability makes transfusional surveys easier and improves transfusions safety. In two of the 130 hospitals, the system is linked to the 'program of medicalization of information systems'. In the 2nd semester of 1996, the traceability proportion was 97\%. For a given date of distribution, 75\% of blood products were traced in 14 days and 83\% in a month. The study of reactivity showed that all donations coming from two randomly chosen blood collection sites could be traced in about 2 hours. This first evaluation of a regional system of traceability showed its feasibility and acceptability, based on evaluation criteria of a public health surveillance system. A continuous evaluation process would be necessary to assess the good functioning of the system and to detect and prevent possible deficiencies.}

  abstract = {The field of animal syndromic surveillance (SyS) is growing, with many systems being developed worldwide. Now is an appropriate time to share ideas and lessons learned from early SyS design and implementation. Based on our practical experience in animal health SyS, with additions from the public health and animal health SyS literature, we put forward for discussion a 6-step approach to designing SyS systems for livestock and poultry. The first step is to formalise policy and surveillance goals which are considerate of stakeholder expectations and reflect priority issues (1). Next, it is important to find consensus on national priority diseases and identify current surveillance gaps. The geographic, demographic, and temporal coverage of the system must be carefully assessed (2). A minimum dataset for SyS that includes the essential data to achieve all surveillance objectives while minimizing the amount of data collected should be defined. One can then compile an inventory of the data sources available and evaluate each using the criteria developed (3). A list of syndromes should then be produced for all data sources. Cases can be classified into syndrome classes and the data can be converted into time series (4). Based on the characteristics of the syndrome-time series, the length of historic data available and the type of outbreaks the system must detect, different aberration detection algorithms can be tested (5). Finally, it is essential to develop a minimally acceptable response protocol for each statistical signal produced (6). Important outcomes of this pre-operational phase should be building of a national network of experts and collective action and evaluation plans. While some of the more applied steps (4 and 5) are currently receiving consideration, more emphasis should be put on earlier conceptual steps by decision makers and surveillance developers (1-3).},

  abstract = {Objective To describe the development of an evaluation framework thatallows quantification of surveillance functions and subsequentaggregation towards an overall score for biosurveillance systemperformance.IntroductionEvaluation and strengthening of biosurveillance systems is acomplex process that involves sequential decision steps, numerousstakeholders, and requires accommodating multiple and conflictingobjectives. Biosurveillance evaluation, the initiating step towardsbiosurveillance strengthening, is a multi-dimensional decisionproblem that can be properly addressed via multi-criteria-decisionmodels.Existing evaluation frameworks tend to focus on ``hard'' technicalattributes (e.g. sensitivity) while ignoring other ``soft'' criteria(e.g. transparency) of difficult measurement and aggregation. Asa result, biosurveillance value, a multi-dimensional entity, is notproperly defined or assessed. Not addressing the entire range of criterialeads to partial evaluations that may fail to convene sufficient supportacross the stakeholders' base for biosurveillance improvements.We seek to develop a generic and flexible evaluation frameworkcapable of integrating the multiple and conflicting criteria and valuesof different stakeholders, and which is sufficiently tractable to allowquantification of the value of specific biosurveillance projects towardsthe overall performance of biosurveillance systems.Methods We chose a Multi Attribute Value Theory model (MAVT) tosupport the development of the evaluation framework. Developmentof the model was done through online decision conferencing sessionswith expert judgement, an indispensable part of MAVT modelling,provided by surveillance experts recruited from the member pool ofthe International Society for Disease Surveillance.The surveillance functions or quality criteria that were consideredfor the framework were initially gathered from a review of theliterature with specific attention to a subset of public health qualitycriteria (1). Group discussions with the experts led to a final list offunctions, finally reviewed to comply with the properties for goodcriteria in decision models. The eleven functions were: sensitivity;timeliness; positive predictive value (PPV); transparency; versatility;multiple utility; representativeness; sustainability; advancing thefield and innovation; risk reduction; and actionable information.In addition, 24 different scenarios were developed for sensitivity,PPV, and timeliness since their values may differ with the level ofinfectiousness of the condition/event of interest, its severity andthe availability of treatment and/or prevention measures. Four orfive levels of performance were also developed for each criterion.Macbeth (Measuring Attractiveness by a Category-Based EvaluationTechnique) tables were used to elicit values of different levels ofperformance from the experts using qualitative pairwise comparisonsand then convert them into numerical values.ResultsTo date, two criteria, sensitivity and transparency, have beenassessed by more than one expert working on the same scenario.Value functions were generated for each criterion and scenario bycalculating the median of the different values produced by the experts.For both sensitivity and transparency, value functions were mostlylinear, indicating similar preferences between levels of performance.However, for some scenarios, experts allocated greater value toincreases at the higher end of the performance level distribution.Conclusions At the time of writing new elicitation sessions are planned toconclude the model. Next, we will apply swing weights to supportthe trade-offs between the different criteria. We will present thebaseline model elicitated from the experts and demonstrate howto apply portfolio decision analysis to assess overall performanceof biosurveillance systems according to the specific needs ofstakeholders and in conjunction with macro-epidemiological models.},

  abstract = {Spotted fever is caused by rickettsia species, and is the most important tick-borne disease. In Brazil, it requires national compulsory notification to the Ministry of Health. Since 2007, all suspected cases of spotted fever have been integrated into the Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN). In this descriptive study we evaluate the timeliness (expressed in number of days between time of clinical suspicion and reporting) of the compulsory notification of spotted fever cases in SINAN and the strategy for digital disease detection (DDD). This study analysed the information from the SINAN and from the digital detection strategy used by ProMED-Portugues. Results show that detection by the SINAN system was more efficient than Promed-Portugues, reporting 90.4\% of evaluated suspected cases 20.5days earlier. The surveillance strategy based on the mandatory case reporting using SINAN has proven to be more timely, but DDD can be considered as a complementary strategy providing a more disseminate epidemiological information to wide range readership globally.

In recent years, new automated HAI surveillance methods have emerged with the wide adoption of electronic health records (EHR). Here we present the validation results against the gold standard of HAIs diagnosis of the InNoCBR system deployed in the Ourense University Hospital Complex (Spain). Acting as a totally autonomous system, InNoCBR achieves a HAI sensitivity of 70.83\% and a specificity of 97.76\%, with a positive predictive value of 77.24\%. The kappa index for infection type classification is 0.67. Sensitivity varies depending on infection type, where bloodstream infection attains the best value (93.33\%), whereas the respiratory infection could be improved the most (53.33\%). Working as a semi-automatic system, InNoCBR reaches a high level of sensitivity (81.73\%), specificity (99.47\%), and a meritorious positive predictive value (94.33\%).

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Malaria surveillance system strengthening is essential in the progress towards malaria elimination. In Nigeria, more attention is being given to this recently as the country is striving towards achieving elimination. However, the surveillance system performance is fraught with challenges including poor data quality with varying magnitude by state. This study evaluated the operation of the Kano State malaria surveillance system and assessed its key attributes., METHODS: An observational study design comprising a survey, record review and secondary data analysis, and mixed methods data collection approach were used. Four key stakeholders' and 35 Roll Back Malaria Focal Persons (RBMs) semi-structured interviews on operation of the system and attributes of the surveillance system, were conducted. We analyzed the abstracted 2013-2016 National Health Management Information System web-based malaria datasets. The surveillance system was evaluated using the "2001 United States Centers for Disease Control's updated guidelines for Evaluating Public Health Surveillance Systems". Data were described using means, standard deviation, frequencies and proportions. Chi-squared for linear trends was used., RESULTS: Overall, 24 RBMs (68.6\%) had {$<$}= 15-year experience on malaria surveillance, 29 (82.9\%) had formal training on malaria surveillance; 32 RBMs (91.4\%) reported case definitions were easy-to-use, reporting forms were easy-to-fill and data flow channels were clearly defined. Twenty-seven respondents (69.2\%) reported data tools could accommodate changes and all RBMs understood malaria case definitions. All respondents (4 stakeholders and 34 RBMs [97.1\%]) expressed willingness to continue using the system and 33 (84.6\%) reported analyzed data were used for decision-making. Public health facilities constituted the main data source. Overall, 65.0\% of funding were from partner agencies. Trend of malaria cases showed significant decline (chi2trend = 7.49; P = 0.0006). Timeliness of reporting was below the target ({$>$}= 80\%), except being 82\% in 2012., CONCLUSIONS: Malaria surveillance system in Kano State was simple, flexible, acceptable, useful and donor-driven but the data were not representative of all health facilities. Timeliness of reporting was suboptimal. We recommended reporting from private health facilities, strengthening human resource capacity for supportive supervision and ensuring adequate government funding to enhance the system's representativeness and improve data quality.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Outbreaks of several serious infectious diseases have occurred in recent years. In response, to mitigate public health risks, countries worldwide have dedicated efforts to establish an information system for effective disease monitoring, risk assessment, and early warning management for international disease outbreaks. A cloud computing framework can effectively provide the required hardware resources and information access and exchange to conveniently connect information related to infectious diseases and develop a cross-system surveillance and control system for infectious diseases., OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to develop a Hospital Automated Laboratory Reporting (HALR) system based on such a framework and evaluate its effectiveness., METHODS: We collected data for 6 months and analyzed the cases reported within this period by the HALR and the Web-based Notifiable Disease Reporting (WebNDR) systems. Furthermore, system evaluation indicators were gathered, including those evaluating sensitivity and specificity., RESULTS: The HALR system reported 15 pathogens and 5174 cases, and the WebNDR system reported 34 cases. In a comparison of the two systems, sensitivity was 100\% and specificity varied according to the reported pathogens. In particular, the specificity for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, and hepatitis C virus were 99.8\%, 96.6\%, and 97.4\%, respectively. However, the specificity for influenza virus and hepatitis B virus were only 79.9\% and 47.1\%, respectively. After the reported data were integrated with patients' diagnostic results in their electronic medical records (EMRs), the specificity for influenza virus and hepatitis B virus increased to 89.2\% and 99.1\%, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: The HALR system can provide early reporting of specified pathogens according to test results, allowing for early detection of outbreaks and providing trends in infectious disease data. The results of this study show that the sensitivity and specificity of early disease detection can be increased by integrating the reported data in the HALR system with the cases' clinical information (eg, diagnostic results) in EMRs, thereby enhancing the control and prevention of infectious diseases.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Influenza is an acute respiratory infectious disease with a high incidence rate in the Chinese army, which directly disturbs military training and affects soldiers' health. Influenza surveillance systems are widely used around the world and play an important role in influenza epidemic prevention and control., METHODS: As a theater centers for disease prevention and control, we established an influenza monitoring platform (IMP) in 2014 to strengthen the monitoring of influenza-like illness and influenza virus infection. In this study, we introduced the constitution, influenza virus detection, and quality control for an IMP. The monitoring effect was also evaluated by comparing the monitoring data with data from national influenza surveillance systems. The experiences and problems associated with the platform also were summarized., RESULTS: A theater IMP was established based on 3 levels of medical units, including monitoring sites, testing laboratories and a checking laboratory. A series of measures were taken to guarantee the quality of monitoring, such as technical training, a unified process, sufficient supervision and timely communication. The platform has run smoothly for 3 monitoring years to date. In the 2014-2015 and 2016-2017 monitoring years, sample amount coincided with that obtained from the National Influenza Surveillance program. In the 2015-2016 monitoring year, due to the strict prevention and control measures, an influenza epidemic peak was avoided in monitoring units, and the monitoring data did not coincide with that of the National Influenza Surveillance program. Several problems, including insufficient attention, unreasonable administrative intervention or subordination relationships, and the necessity of detection in monitoring sites were still observed., CONCLUSIONS: A theater IMP was established rationally and played a deserved role in the prevention and control of influenza. However, several problems remain to be solved.},

And related human resource and budget data in 2012 were collected for analysis., RESULTS: From 2006 to 2012, the injury cases reported to national injury surveillance system increased by 1 time in China. The underreporting rate of injury cases and mis-filling rate of reporting cards decreased in 31 surveillance points (72.1\%) and 23 surveillance points (53.5\%) respectively. In 2012, the underreporting rates were less than 10\% in 33 surveillance points (76.7\%) , and the mis-filling rates were less than 10\% in 39 surveillance points (90.7\%) . Only 19 provincial CDCs (44.2\%) and 32 county/district CDCs had full time staff engaged in injury surveillance. Three surveillance points (7.0\%) never published their injury surveillance data, while 13 surveillance points shared injury surveillance data with other departments., CONCLUSION: The quality of injury surveillance was greatly improved in China during 2006-2012, but more efforts are still needed for the further improvement of national injury surveillance, including the increase of human resources and fund investments and more use of surveillance data.},

Methods: The data of national notifiable communicable disease surveillance between 2005 and 2008 were collected to conduct the quality evaluation with the different indicators. Structured query language (SQL) was used during the data query and analysis. Results: The quality of internet-based reporting of notifiable communicable diseases was improved by years from 2005 to 2008. The rate of timely reporting failure, timely verifying failure and repeated reporting was 3.04\%, 0.64\% and 0.01\% respectively in 2008, which declined by 89.76\%, 92.90\% and 91.67\% respectively compared with 2005. The reporting quality in the central part of China was improved during this period, but the reporting quality in the western part was poor. The timeliness of disease reporting and data verifying were improved gradually, which was 0.57 d and 43 min respectively in 2008. The rate of reporting completeness reached 94.53\%. Conclusion: The quality of internet-based reporting of communicable diseases is the basis of the disease control and prevention in China. The quality of the reporting had been improved since 2005, but it is still necessary to conduct supervision and evaluation regularly, provide sufficient operation fund and strengthen staff training for the further improvement, especially in the western part of China.},

To promote comparability between studies, it is essential that standardised methods are developed for the evaluation of outbreak detection methods., METHODS: This analysis aims to review approaches used to evaluate outbreak detection methods and provide a conceptual framework upon which recommendations for standardised evaluation methods can be based. We reviewed the recently published literature for reports which evaluated methods for the detection of infectious disease outbreaks in public health surveillance data. Evaluation methods identified in the recent literature were categorised according to the presence of common features to provide a conceptual basis within which to understand current approaches to evaluation., RESULTS: There was considerable variation in the approaches used for the evaluation of methods for the detection of outbreaks in public health surveillance data, and appeared to be no single approach of choice. Four main approaches were used to evaluate performance, and these were labelled the Descriptive, Derived, Epidemiological and Simulation approaches. Based on the approaches identified, we propose a basic framework for evaluation and recommend the use of multiple approaches to evaluation to enable a comprehensive and contextualised description of outbreak detection performance., CONCLUSION: The varied nature of performance evaluation demonstrated in this review supports the need for further development of evaluation methods to improve comparability between studies. Our findings indicate that no single approach can fulfil all evaluation requirements. We propose that the cornerstone approaches to evaluation identified provide key contributions to support internal and external validity and comparability of study findings, and suggest these be incorporated into future recommendations for performance assessment.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: World Health Organization (WHO) targets for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance, including the notification of a minimum rate of AFP among children, are used to assess the adequacy of AFP surveillance for the detection of poliovirus infection. Sensitive surveillance for poliovirus infection in both developed and developing countries is essential to support global disease eradication efforts. We applied recently developed methods for the quantitative evaluation of disease surveillance systems to evaluate the sensitivity of AFP surveillance for poliovirus infection in Australia., METHODS: A scenario tree model which accounted for administrative region, age, population immunity, the likelihood of AFP, and the probability of notification and stool sampling was used to assess the sensitivity of AFP surveillance for wild poliovirus infection among children aged less than 15 years in Australia. The analysis was based on historical surveillance data collected between 2000 and 2005. We used a surveillance time period of one month, and evaluated the ability of the surveillance system to detect poliovirus infection at a prevalence of 1 case per 100 000 persons and 1 case per million persons., RESULTS: There was considerable variation in the sensitivity of AFP surveillance for poliovirus infection among Australian States and Territories. The estimated median sensitivity of AFP surveillance in Australia among children aged less than 15 years was 8.2\% per month at a prevalence of 1 case per 100,000 population, and 0.9\% per month at a prevalence of 1 case per million population. The probability that Australia is free from poliovirus infection given negative surveillance findings following 5 years of continuous surveillance was 96.9\% at a prevalence of 1 case per 100,000 persons and 56.5\% at a prevalence of 1 case per million persons., CONCLUSION: Given the ongoing risk of poliovirus importation prior to global eradication, long term surveillance is required to provide a high degree of confidence in freedom from poliovirus infection in Australia, particularly if a low prevalence of infection is assumed. Adherence to the WHO surveillance targets would considerably improve the sensitivity of surveillance for poliovirus infection in Australia.}

Models projected the total population size to be 5720 (95\% CI 5587-6190), estimating the surveillance system as 87\% complete. Subgroup analyses identified groups facing a disproportionate burden of HIV as more likely to be detected by the surveillance list.

The purpose of this evaluation was to assess the ability of the surveillance system from 2006 to 2012 to meet the objectives of the Bhutan Vector-borne Disease Control Program (VDCP) and to highlight priorities requiring attention as the nation transitions to elimination., METHODS: The evaluation was conducted using the Center for Disease Control guidelines for evaluating public health surveillance systems. Data sources included a search of publically available literature, VDCP program data, and interviews with malaria surveillance personnel. Blood slide quality assurance and control through formal assessment of slide preparation and measures of between-reader correlation were performed., RESULTS: Total malaria cases declined from 2006 to 2012. The average slide positivity rate decreased from 3.4\% in 2006 to 0.2\% in 2012. The proportion of non-residents in all cases increased to its highest value of 22.6\% in 2012, and significant clustering in the border regions of India was noted, with Sarpang accounting for more cases than any other district from 2009 onward. Case detection was almost exclusively passive, but flexibility and sensitivity was demonstrated by the later addition of active case detection and specification of imported and locally acquired cases. Spatial data were limited to the village level, not allowing identification of transmission hotspots. For blood smears, statistical measures of between-reader agreement and predictive value were not computed. Blood smear quality was suboptimal by at least one criterion in over half of evaluated smears. Timeliness in reporting of cases was on a weekly to monthly basis, and did not meet the WHO goal of immediate notification., CONCLUSION: As of 2012, the national malaria surveillance system demonstrated flexibility, representativeness, simplicity, and stability. The full potential for data analysis was not yet realized. Attaining the goal of malaria elimination will require system function enhancement through increased and more accurate case detection and rapid investigation, improved health worker training and accountability, focally targeted response measures, and, in particular, the challenge of finding re-introductions of infections from India. Many such measure have been undertaken or planned as part of the next phase of the Bhutan's National Strategic Plan.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To use laboratory data to assess the specificity of syndromes used by the New York City emergency department (ED) syndromic surveillance system to monitor influenza activity., DESIGN: For the period from October 1, 2009 through March 31, 2010, we examined the correlation between citywide ED syndrome assignment and laboratory-confirmed influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). In addition, ED syndromic data from five select NYC hospitals were matched at the patient and visit level to corresponding laboratory reports of influenza and RSV. The matched dataset was used to evaluate syndrome assignment by disease and to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of the influenza-like illness (ILI) syndrome., RESULTS: Citywide ED visits for ILI correlated well with influenza laboratory diagnoses (R=0.92). From October 1, 2009, through March 31, 2010, there were 264,532 ED visits at the five select hospitals, from which the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) received confirmatory laboratory reports of 655 unique cases of influenza and 1348 cases of RSV. The ED visit of most (56\%) influenza cases had been categorized in the fever/flu syndrome; only 15\% were labeled ILI. Compared to other influenza-related syndromes, ILI had the lowest sensitivity (15\%) but the highest specificity (90\%) for laboratory-confirmed influenza. Sensitivity and specificity varied by age group and influenza activity level., CONCLUSIONS: The ILI syndrome in the NYC ED syndromic surveillance system served as a specific but not sensitive indicator for influenza during the 2009-2010 influenza season. Despite its limited sensitivity, the ILI syndrome can be more informative for tracking influenza trends than the fever/flu or respiratory syndromes because it is less likely to capture cases of other respiratory viruses. However, ED ILI among specific age groups should be interpreted alongside laboratory surveillance data. ILI remains a valuable tool for monitoring influenza activity and trends as it facilitates comparisons nationally and across jurisdictions and is easily communicated to the public.}

We reviewed the line lists generated by each query and used the diagnosis code and chief complaint text fields to find probable cases of heat-related illness. For each query, we calculated positive predictive values (PPVs) for heat-related illness., RESULTS: The CSTE query identified 674 records, of which 591 were categorized as probable heat-related illness, demonstrating a PPV of 88\% for heat-related illness. The BioSense query identified 791 patient records, of which 589 were probable heat-related illness, demonstrating a PPV of 74\% for heat-related illness. The PPV was substantially higher for the CSTE novel and BioSense queries during the heat season (May 1 to September 30; 92\% and 85\%, respectively) than during the cooler seasons (55\% and 29\%, respectively)., CONCLUSION: A novel query for heat-related illness that combined diagnosis codes, chief complaint text terms, and exclusion criteria had a high PPV for heat-related illness, particularly during the heat season. Public health departments can use this query to meet local needs; however, use of this novel query to substantially improve public health heat-related illness prevention remains to be seen.},

The enhanced Invasive Pneumococcal Disease Surveillance System (eIPDSS) pilot project was designed to facilitate a better understanding of IPD trends at the national level by linking epidemiologic and laboratory (epi-lab) data., OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the eIPDSS by assessing five attributes (usefulness, data quality, simplicity, acceptability and timeliness) and to develop recommendations for future national IPD surveillance., METHODS: An evaluation was developed that assessed the five key attributes through a qualitative survey sent to eight eIPDSS users as well as a quantitative analysis of the eIPDSS database. Recommendations were based on the results of both the survey and the analysis., RESULTS: The response rate to the survey was 100\%. The majority of the survey respondents found the eIPDSS to be useful (75\%), simple (100\%) and acceptable (86\%). Analysis of the eIPDSS database revealed that the majority of IPD cases (61\%) were assessed as timely. Data quality and data management mechanisms were identified as issues by both survey respondents and the analysis of the database. Consultation with public health, regular audits and upgrades to the platform are recommended to address data quality and management issues., CONCLUSION: The epi-lab linked data of the eIPDSS enables the detection and analysis of IPD serotype distribution and antimicrobial resistance trends. This web-based system facilitates data collection and is simple, acceptable and timely. With improvements that address data quality and management issues, it is feasible to develop a national surveillance system that links epi-lab data.},

In reviewing the pandemic surveillance strategy, we evaluated the utility of case-based data collection and the challenges in interpreting these data at the global level. To do this, we assessed compliance with the surveillance recommendation and data completeness of submitted case records and described the epidemiological characteristics of up to the first 110 reported cases from each country, aggregated into regions. From April 2009 to August 2011, WHO received over 18 000 case records from 84 countries. Data reached WHO at different time intervals, in different formats and without information on collection methods. Just over half of the 18 000 records gave the date of symptom onset, which made it difficult to assess whether the cases were among the earliest to be confirmed. Descriptive epidemiological analyses were limited to summarizing age, sex and hospitalization ratios. Centralized analysis of case-based data had little value in describing key features of the pandemic. Results were difficult to interpret and would have been misleading if viewed in isolation. A better approach would be to identify critical questions, standardize data elements and methods of investigation, and create efficient channels for communication between countries and the international public health community. Regular exchange of routine surveillance data will help to consolidate these essential channels of communication.},

  abstract = {Advance information about the timing and locations of malaria epidemics allows more effective targeting of resources for prevention, control, and treatment. However, these predictions must be accurate to ensure that potential outbreaks are not missed and resources are not wasted responding to predicted outbreaks that do not occur. Early warning systems based on environmental monitoring can identify critical risk factors before an epidemic actually starts, but their accuracy is constrained by the complex interrelationships of climatic variability, mosquito population dynamics, malaria transmission, and the resulting risk of human infection. In contrast, early detection of malaria epidemics based on epidemiological surveillance can be more reliable because it is conditioned on direct observations, but it offers limited lead time and is dependent on timely, accurate surveillance data. Ideally, a malaria forecasting system that integrates elements of both early warning and early detection should be able to leverage the strengths and minimize the limitations of each approach. One reason for this lack of integration is a dearth of suitable tools and techniques. In response, we have developed a conceptual framework for the Epidemic Prognosis Incorporating Disease and Environmental Monitoring for Integrated Assessment (EPIDEMIA) computer system. This framework includes definitions of system users and their associated use cases, identification of critical input data, and a scientific workflow for integrating these spatially and temporally heterogeneous data streams to yield predictions of malaria risk. The system will be tested by implementing it in the Amhara Region of Ethiopia in collaboration with local stakeholders in the NGO and public health sectors. This innovative translational approach to health informatics will enable us to assess the practical effectiveness of the tools and continually upgrade and improve the technologies.},

Mobile phone-based applications for malaria reporting, case management, and surveillance implemented at a community-level may overcome reporting limitations associated with current paper-based reporting (PBR), but their effectiveness in this context is unknown., METHODS: A mixed methods evaluation study was undertaken to determine the effectiveness of a national Malaria Case-Based Reporting (MCBR) mobile phone application in improving malaria case reporting compared to the existing PBR reporting system in Myanmar. Methods included secondary analysis of malaria case report data, questionnaires, focus group discussions and field observations of community volunteers, interviews and direct observations of malaria programme stakeholders, and cost analysis. Using a combination of these approaches the following areas were investigated: data quality and completeness, data access and usage, capacity for timely reporting, the acceptability, functionality, and ease of use of the application and facilitators and barriers to its use, and the relative cost of MCBR compared to the PBR system., RESULTS: Compared to PBR, MCBR enabled more accurate and complete data to be reported in a much timelier manner, with 63\% of MCBR users reporting they transmit rapid diagnostic test outcomes within 24 h, compared to 0\% of PBR users. MCBR was favoured by integrated community malaria volunteers and their supervisors because of its efficiency. However, several technical and operational challenges associated with internet coverage, data transmission, and e-literacy were identified and stakeholders reported not being confident to rely solely on MCBR data for programmatic decision-making., CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of MCBR provided timely and accurate data for malaria surveillance. Findings from this evaluation study will enable the optimization of an application-based reporting system for malaria monitoring and surveillance in the Greater Mekong Subregion and advance systems to track progress towards, and certify, the achievement of malaria elimination targets.},

While wheat flour mills are often inspected by agencies affiliated with national ministries to ensure compliance with national fortification standards, few countries use data derived from these inspections to construct an external monitoring system for use in program management and evaluation. The primary objective of this paper is to assess the performance of the external monitoring system utilized in Jordan according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Updated Guidelines for Evaluating Public Health Surveillance Systems. A secondary objective is to present mill monitoring results from 2009 to 2010 in order to demonstrate the data generated by the system. The review concludes that the data required for the system is representative, simple to collect, and can be collected in a flexible manner. The external monitoring system is acceptable to participating agencies and millers and is stable due to mandatory fortification legislation which provides the legal framework for external monitoring. Data on production of fortified flour and utilization of premix can be provided in a timely manner, but on-site mill monitoring and flour sample collection are more challenging due to resource constraints. The frequent collection of a small number of indicators can provide fortification program managers with timely information with which to base decisions. Jordan's external monitoring system successfully documented the performance of each mill and the entire flour fortification program, and can serve as a model for other national fortification programs considering external monitoring approaches.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In Norway, Legionnaires' disease is reportable upon clinical suspicion to public health authorities and mandatorily notifiable through the Norwegian surveillance system for communicable diseases (MSIS) for both clinicians and laboratories. In the summer of 2017, several European countries reported high notification rates for Legionnaires' disease, which was not observed in Norway. We evaluated MSIS to assess if it meets its objectives of detecting cases and trends in incidence of Legionnaires' disease., METHODS: We retrieved MSIS data from 2008 to 2017 and calculated timeliness as days from sampling to notification, and internal completeness for key variables as the proportion of observations with a value. Where possible, we assessed internal validity on the presence of a plausible value. To estimate external completeness and validity we linked MSIS with hospital reimbursement claims in the Norwegian Patient Registry. To assess acceptability and representativeness, we surveyed doctors in 39 hospitals on their units' diagnostic and notification procedures, and their use of MSIS., RESULTS: There were 438 notified cases. Internal completeness and internal validity were high for key variables ({$>$}=95\%). The median delay from sampling to notification was 4 days. There were 73 patients in MSIS only, 70 in the Norwegian Patient Registry only, and 351 in both registers. The external completeness of MSIS was 83\% (95\% CI 80-86\%). For external validity, the positive predictive value of MSIS was 83\% (95\% CI 79-86\%). Forty-seven respondents from 28 hospitals described testing procedures. These were inconsistent: 29 (62\%) reported no systematic application of criteria for requesting legionella testing. Eighteen (38\%) reported testing all patients with suspected pneumonia and a travel history. Thirty-one (66\%) found the notification criteria clear., CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the surveillance in MSIS can detect incidence changes for Legionnaires' disease over time, by place and person, but likely does not detect every case diagnosed in Norway. We recommend wider investigation of diagnostic procedures in order to improve representativeness and awareness of MSIS notification criteria among clinicians in order to improve acceptability of the surveillance. We also recommend a more comprehensive assessment of whether patients only registered in the Norwegian Patient Registry were true Legionnaires' disease cases.},

We applied a monitoring and evaluation framework that combined policy changes with timely, relevant cross-sector data and community review. Indicators covered unemployment, basic needs, family violence, education, childcare, access to health care, and mental, physical, and behavioral health. In response to increasing COVID-19 cases, nonpharmaceutical intervention strategies were implemented in March 2020 in King County, Washington. By December 2020, 554 000 unemployment claims were filed. Social service calls increased 100\%, behavioral health crisis calls increased 25\%, and domestic violence calls increased 25\%, with disproportionate impact on communities of color. This framework can be replicated by local jurisdictions to inform and address racial inequities in ongoing COVID-19 mitigation and recovery. Cross-sector collaboration between public health and sectors addressing the social determinants of health are an essential first step to have an impact on long-standing racial inequities.

  abstract = {Background: In order to facilitate public health response and to achieve early control of infectious disease epidemics, an adjustable epidemiologic information system (AEIS) was established in the Taiwan public health network in February 2006. Methodology/Principal Findings: The performance of AEIS for the period 2006 through 2008 was evaluated based on a number of response times (RT) and the public health impact. After implementation of the system, the apparent overall shortened RT was mainly due to the shortening of personnel response time (PRT) and the time needed to draft a new questionnaire that incurred as personnel-system interface (PSI); PRT dropped from a fluctuating range of 9.8{\textasciitilde}28.8 days in the first four months to{$<$}10 days in the following months and remained low till 2008 (0.88+/-1.52 days). The PSIs for newly emerged infectious diseases were 2.6 and 3.4 person-hours for H5N1 in 2007 and chikungunya in 2008, respectively, a much improvement from 1142.5 person-hours for SARS in 2003. The duration of each rubella epidemic cluster was evaluated as public health impact and showed a shortening trend (p = 0.019) that concurred with the shortening of PRT from 64.8+/-47.3 to 25.2+/-38.2 hours per cluster (p{$<$}0.0001). Conclusions/Significance: The first evaluation of the novel instrument AEIS that had been used to assist Taiwan's multilevel government for infectious diseases control demonstrated that it was well integrated into the existing public health infrastructure. It provided flexible tools and computer algorithms with friendly interface for timely data collection, integration, and analysis; as a result, it shortened RTs, filled in gaps of personnel lacking sufficient experiences, created a more efficient flow of response, and identified asymptomatic/mild cases early to minimize further spreading. With further development, AEIS is anticipated to be useful in the application of other acute public health events needing immediate orchestrated data collection and public health actions. {\copyright} 2011 Wu et al.}

  abstract = {Objective: To analyze the consistency of the data from past influenza surveillance system and new school syndrome surveillance system, and evaluate the effect of the combined use of a variety of monitoring modes in Longgang district of Shenzhen city. Methods: All data during 2011-2014 were compared to data from the Shenzhen Disease Control Information System. Representativeness, authenticity, stability, timeliness and other aspects of the two systems were evaluated to reveal their early warning effects. Results: The monitoring system data showed a certain representation since influenza sentinel sites covered 34.30\% of the region's population. The sensitivity and specificity of the system were valued by the indicator of 5\% increase of ILI\% compared with the previous five weeks. The specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value were 91.43\%, 62.50\% and 72.73\%, respectively, but the sensitivity was only 29.71\%. The system showed lower sensitivity, reported ILI\% ahead of one weeks showed a good correlation (r=0.45, P{$<$}0.05) between Student Health Information Monitoring System and Information Management System for Disease Control. Conclusion: The existing influenza surveillance system in Longgang district has certain representativeness, and good reliability and stability. But the sensitivity and specificity of the monitoring system need to be improved.},

  abstract = {Wastewater surveillance has emerged as a useful tool in the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic. While wastewater surveillance has been applied at various scales to monitor population-level COVID-19 dynamics, there is a need for quantitative metrics to interpret wastewater data in the context of public health trends. 24-hour composite wastewater samples were collected from March 2020 through May 2021 from a Massachusetts wastewater treatment plant and SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations were measured using RT-qPCR. The relationship between wastewater copy numbers of SARS-CoV-2 gene fragments and COVID-19 clinical cases and deaths varies over time. We demonstrate the utility of three new metrics to monitor changes in COVID-19 epidemiology: (1) the ratio between wastewater copy numbers of SARS-CoV-2 gene fragments and clinical cases (WC ratio), (2) the time lag between wastewater and clinical reporting, and (3) a transfer function between the wastewater and clinical case curves. The WC ratio increases after key events, providing insight into the balance between disease spread and public health response. Time lag and transfer function analysis showed that wastewater data preceded clinically reported cases in the first wave of the pandemic but did not serve as a leading indicator in the second wave, likely due to increased testing capacity, which allows for more timely case detection and reporting. These three metrics could help further integrate wastewater surveillance into the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics. Copyright {\copyright} 2022.

Methods: The data of MSS in 7 districts of Zhenjiang City from 2009-2013 were collected. Descriptive epidemiological method was used to analyze the epidemiological characteristics of measles and evaluate the major operating indicators of MSS. Results: The average annual incidence rate of non-measles cases was 2.56/lakh in Zhenjiang City from 2009-2013. The blood specimen collection rate of suspected cases increased from 95.13\% in 2009 to 100\% in 2013. The rate of suspected case investigation within 48 hours increased from 95.13\% in 2009 to 100\% in 2013. The rate of serum specimens delivered within 3 days increased from 93.57\% in 2009 to 100\% in 2013. The rate of the serological test results reported within 7 days increased from 94.28\% in 2009 to 100\% in 2013. The epidemic situation of measles showed the obvious seasonality, the peak appeared March to May, which included 140 cases, accounting for 85.89\% of total cases. As for the age distribution, most of cases were in the children group and old group, and patients in middle aged group accounted for small proportion. 90.18\% of patients had no immunization history or had an unknown immunization history, only 9.82\% had the clear immunization history. Conclusion: The measles surveillance system in Zhenjiang City has operated in a good condition from 2009-2013, and the operation quality has increased gradually. It is necessary to strengthen measles monitoring, enhance the public immune level, and improve the prevention and control in key populations, to keep measles elimination status.},

Overdue reports, overdue verification, duplication report rates, and county-level report omissions were calculated as the quality indicators based on the surveillance data from the Disease Surveillance Information Report Management System. SAS 9.0 was used for a comprehensive evaluation of the information quality. From 2004 to 2007, a total of 565{\enspace}184 report cards on notifiable infectious diseases were reported, including 105{\enspace}447 overdue report cards, 38{\enspace}543 overdue verification, 3065 duplicated cards and 19 report-omitted counties. The overdue report rate was 18.66\%; the overdue verification rate 6.83\%; the duplication report rate was 0.05\%; and the county report omission rate was 0.46\%. The interval between diagnosis and the reporting of an infectious case was 0.70 d, and the interval between the reporting and verification was 0.95 h. The report quality was found to improve by year; a higher quality was found in Xiamen, Fuzhou, and a lower quality was seen in Nanping and Ningde. The quality of infectious disease reporting in Fujian was found to improve from 2004 to 2007. However, regional imbalances in reporting quality were identified; Nanping and Ningde should be responsible for improving the quality of reporting on epidemic information. Since overdue reports by medical institutions has exerted a direct impact on the performance of the direct network report in Fujian, it is necessary to further strengthen the territorial management, guidance and supervision of epidemic reports for institutions for disease prevention and control at all levels.},

Methods: Questionnaire was taken to know awareness of the iodized salt surveillance in professional staff, and evaluation on monitoring quality was carried out from sampling, field, laboratory and data recording. Content of iodized salt was quantitatively determined according to direct titration in GB/T13025.7-1999. Results: No one of the staff could answer the questions correctly. The accuracy rate was from 11.1\% to 96.30\%. The influencing factors were lacking fund, fewer professional staff, etc. Actual sampling rate was 100\% in half of districts and counties. Data sheets of the 80.00\% districts and counties were completed and reported within the stipulated time. The accuracy rate of data recording and reporting was 99.69\%. There were problems such as instability and inconvenience in the iodized salt surveillance software. Coincidence rate of laboratory samples checking of 40\% districts and counties was more than 70\%, with good measurement technique and high reliability. Conclusions: The new National Surveillance Program of Iodinated Salt still needs systemic training to enhance supervision and examination continually, sort out all links, build up the professional staff, and enlarge fund investment so as to keep the work persistence. Besides, the program should be further revised, especially in the aspects of humanistic design and functions of use.},

  abstract = {The natural history of Ehrlichia chaffeensis, the causative agent of human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis, includes the lone star tick (LST, Amblyomma americanum) as a vector and white-tailed deer (WTD; Odocoileus virginianus) as both a natural reservoir of E. chaffeensis and a major host of LST. The goal of the current study was to implement and evaluate a prototype surveillance system to delineate the geographic distribution of E. chaffeensis using WTD as natural sentinels. To accomplish this goal, serologic testing using the indirect immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) test was performed on WTD serum samples, and to confirm serologic results, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays and culture isolation were conducted. Considerations relevant to the applicability of a surveillance system utilizing WTD were analyzed (e.g., age and gender relationships to serologic status, adequacy of sample sizes needed to distinguish between uninfected and infected populations, presence of LST, and ability to detect stability and spread of E. chaffeensis in WTD populations). Of 3275 WTD serologically tested, 549 (47\%) from 17 of 18 states had antibodies reactive to E. chaffeensis (IFA titer {$>$} or = 1:128). No difference between age groups or gender was noted with serologic testing, thus these variables would not be a concern for a surveillance system using WTD. Significantly more deer in younger age groups ({$<$} or = 1.5 yr) were PCR and culture positive, and 46\% of 122 seropositive WTD populations were confirmed positive by PCR or culture isolation. A significant association between LST infestation and E. chaffeensis seroreactivity was noted. Furthermore, the surveillance system was able to detect stability of E. chaffeensis within WTD populations and also spread to new populations, both of which were associated with LST status. These data clearly demonstrate that WTD are useful as natural sentinels for this emerging human pathogen, and establish a prototypical framework for a WTD surveillance system.}

Surveillance of tobacco-related cancers (TRC) is critical for monitoring trends and evaluating tobacco control programmes. We analysed the trends of TRC and evaluated the population-based cancer registry (PBCR) in Delhi for simplicity, comparability, validity, timeliness and representativeness., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We interviewed key informants, observed registry processes and analysed the PBCR dataset for the period 1988-2009 using the 2009 TRC definition of the International Agency for Research on Cancer. We calculated the percentages of morphologically verified cancers, death certificate-only (DCO) cases, missing values of key variables and the time between cancer diagnosis and registration or publication for the year 2009., RESULTS: The number of new cancer cases increased from 5,854 to 15,244 (160\%) during 1988-2009. TRC constituted 58\% of all cancers among men and 47\% among women in 2009. The age-adjusted incidence rates of TRC per 100,000 population increased from 64.2 to 97.3 among men, and from 66.2 to 69.2 among women during 1988-2009. Data on all cancer cases presenting at all major government and private health facilities are actively collected by the PBCR staff using standard paper-based forms. Data abstraction and coding is conducted manually following ICD-10 classifications. Eighty per cent of cases were morphologically verified and 1\% were identified by death certificate only. Less than 1\% of key variables had missing values. The median time to registration and publishing was 13 and 32 months, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: The burden of TRC in Delhi is high and increasing. The Delhi PBCR is well organized and generates high-quality, representative data. However, data could be published earlier if paper-based data are replaced by electronic data abstraction.},

In 2018, OOPHP evaluated the performance of the OSH surveillance system and identified areas for future improvement. Methods: Following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated guidelines for evaluating public health surveillance systems, the OOPHP evaluation team engaged internal and external stakeholders using a mixed-methods approach. Operational measures for ten surveillance attributes were developed. Multiple data collection methods resulted in credible evidence for evaluation conclusions. Analyses included summary statistics and qualitative analysis of interviews, a focus group, and online surveys. Results: Twenty stakeholders took part in this evaluation, with an average participation rate of 55\%. Results showed the Oregon OSH surveillance system was simple, flexible, and highly accepted by its stakeholders. Funding security presents challenges for stability. A lack of timeliness of OHIs, low relevance of OHIs to local OSH issues, and the system's ineffectual data dissemination all limit the usefulness of the OSH surveillance system. A review of key data sources for the system showed good data quality and predictive value positive, but relatively poor sensitivity and representativeness. Conclusions: The evaluation team successfully adapted attributes and examples in the CDC guidelines to this Oregon OSH surveillance evaluation. The evaluation findings have informed the development of recommendations for improvements to OOPHP's OSH surveillance. Future research is needed to develop guidance specific to OSH surveillance evaluation.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Occupational safety and health (OSH) surveillance systems track work-related fatalities, injuries and illnesses as well as the presence of workplace hazards and exposures to inform prevention efforts. Periodic evaluation is critical to the improvement of these systems to meet the demand for more timely, complete, accurate and efficient data processing and analysis. Despite the existence of general guidance for public health surveillance evaluation, no tailored guidance exists for evaluating OSH surveillance systems to date. This study utilized the Delphi technique to collect consensus among experts in the United States on surveillance elements (components, attributes and measures) to inform the development of a tailored evaluation framework.                                         Methods               A Delphi study approach with three survey rounds invited an expert panel to rate and comment on potential OSH surveillance evaluation framework elements, resulting in an optimal list of elements through the panel's consensus. Additionally, experts completed a review of OSH surveillance systems they worked with and answered questions regarding the development of an evaluation framework. Descriptive statistics of the ratings were compiled for the Delphi process. Major themes from experts' comments were further identified using content analysis to inform contextual information underlying their choices.                                         Results               Fifty-four potential experts across the United States were contacted to participate in the Delphi study. Ten experts began the first survey round with eight then seven experts continuing in the subsequent rounds, respectively. A total of 64 surveillance components, 31 attributes, and 116 example measures were selected into the final list through panel consensus, with 134 (63.5\%) reaching high consensus. Major themes regarding current OSH surveillance focused on resources and feasibility, data collection, flexibility, and the inter-relatedness among elements.                                         Conclusions               A Delphi process identified tailored OSH surveillance elements and major themes regarding OSH surveillance. The identified elements can serve as a preliminary guide for evaluating OSH surveillance systems. A more detailed evaluation framework is under development to incorporate these elements into a standard yet flexible approach to OSH surveillance evaluation.},

  abstract = {Objective: To establish a real time detected system, expand the application of the early warning space to the townships (subdistricts)-level and strengthen early warning effect, and to guide the disposal of the epidemic outbreak and the disposal of public health emergencies. Methods: Based on Excel 2010 function, VBA programming, and Active X control, infectious disease monitoring and early warning system in Tianshui city was built. By narrowing the range of search and comparing actual incidence number with threshold value of warning, the range could be locked in the townships (subdistricts) where cases were gathered, so early warning information of emergent public health events could be acquired. The control chart method was used in warning of time-place clustering, number of cases was calculated to obtain the percentile, in the light of different standards, the warning information could be gotten by comparing the percentile with number of cases in the current observation period. Results: There were 14 clusters of outbreaks from January 2014 to October 2016 in Tianshui, 10 incidents were detected by infectious disease monitoring and early warning system, with sensitivity of 71.43\%. Warning information of 287 was obtained, with positive predictive value of 3.48\%, including influenza, foot and mouth disease, and varicella, accounting for the most of the early warning information of 89.2\% of the total. There was a positive correlation between the number of reported cases and the number of early warning information (r=0.771, P{$<$}0.05). Conclusions: With a high sensitivity and positive predictive value, the system can detect clustering occurrence of disease and public health emergencies early and instantly. With burdensome record and manual operation, the system needs to be optimized in future.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study was initiated to evaluate, for the first time, the performance and quality of the influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance system in Tunisia., METHODS: The evaluation covered the period of 2012-2015 and used different data sources to measure indicators related to data quality and completeness, representativeness, timeliness, simplicity, acceptability, flexibility, stability and utility., RESULTS: During the evaluation period, 485.221 ILI cases were reported among 6.386.621 outpatients at 268 ILI sentinel sites. To conserve resources, cases were only enrolled and tested for influenza during times when the number of patients meeting the ILI case definition exceeded 7\% (10\% after 2014) of the total number of outpatients for the week. When this benchmark was met, five to 10 patients were enrolled and sampled by nasopharyngeal swabs the following week. In total, The National Influenza Center (NIC) received 2476 samples, of which 683 (27.6\%) were positive for influenza. The greatest strength of the system was its representativeness and flexibility. The timeliness of the data and the acceptability of the surveillance system performed moderately well; however, the utility of the data and the stability and simplicity of the surveillance system need improvement. Overall, the performance of the Tunisian influenza surveillance system was evaluated as performing moderately well for situational awareness in the country and for collecting representative influenza virologic samples., CONCLUSIONS: The influenza surveillance system in Tunisia provided pertinent evidence for public health interventions related to influenza situational awareness. To better monitor influenza, we propose that ILI surveillance should be limited to sites that are currently performing well and the quality of data collected should be closely monitored and improved.},

Syndromes were defined using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision diagnostic codes in electronic medical records. Health-care organizations transmitted daily counts of new episodes of illness by syndrome, date, and patient zip code. A space-time permutation scan statistic was used to detect unusual clustering. Health departments followed up on e-mailed alerts. Distinct sets of related alerts ("signals") were compared with known outbreaks or clusters found using traditional surveillance., RESULTS: The 62 alerts generated corresponded to 17 distinct signals of a potential outbreak. The signals had a median of eight cases (range: 3-106), seven zip code areas (range: 1-88), and seven days (range: 3-14). Two signals resulted from true clusters of varicella; six were plausible but unconfirmed indications of disease clusters, six were considered spurious, and three were not investigated. The median investigation time per signal by health departments was 50 minutes (range: 0-8 hours). Traditional surveillance picked up 124 clusters of illness in the same period, with a median of six ill per cluster (range: 2-75). None was related to syndromic signals., CONCLUSIONS: The system was able to detect two true clusters of illness, but none was of public health interest. Possibly due to limited population coverage, the system did not detect any of 124 known clusters, many of which were small. The number of false alarms was reasonable.}

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the abilities of population-based birth defects surveillance system (PBBDSS) and hospital-based birth defects surveillance system(HBBDSS). METHODS: We used capture-mark-recapture method(CMR) to analyze the data of the two kinds of birth defects surveillance systems from 1 Oct. 2006 to 31 Dec. 2006 in a county of Hunan province. Data from PBBDSS were defined as the first source and data from HBBDSS were defined as the second source. RESULTS: 49 and 28 birth defect cases were found from PBBDSS and from HBBDSS respectively. Among these cases, 20 were marked. With the method of CMR, the estimated birth defects cases were 68 (95\% CI: 56-70). The coincident rates of PBBDSS and HBBDSS were 72.1\% and 41.2\%, while the total coincident rates was 83.8\% and the coincident rates from different sources was 57.1\%. The unreported rates of PBBDSS and HBBDSS were 27.9\% and 58.8\%. CONCLUSION: Not only the HBBDSS but also the PBBDSS appeared to have had high unreported rates, suggesting that we could use CMR to adjust the rate of birth defects from the birth defects surveillance data.},

Few studies provide comprehensive metadata to inform researchers of data limitations prior to conducting statistical modeling. We described the completeness of 103 variables for 22,792 outbreaks publicly reported by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (US CDC's) electronic Foodborne Outbreak Reporting System (eFORS) and National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS). We compared monthly trends of completeness during eFORS (1998-2008) and NORS (2009-2019) reporting periods using segmented time series analyses adjusted for seasonality. We quantified the overall, annual, and monthly completeness as the percentage of outbreaks with blank records per our study period, calendar year, and study month, respectively. We found that outbreaks of unknown genus (n = 7401), Norovirus (n = 6414), Salmonella (n = 2872), Clostridium (n = 944), and multiple genera (n = 779) accounted for 80.77\% of all outbreaks. However, crude completeness ranged from 46.06\% to 60.19\% across the 103 variables assessed. Variables with the lowest crude completeness (ranging 3.32-6.98\%) included pathogen, specimen etiological testing, and secondary transmission traceback information. Variables with low ({$<$}35\%) average monthly completeness during eFORS increased by 0.33-0.40\%/month after transitioning to NORS, most likely due to the expansion of surveillance capacity and coverage within the new reporting system. Examining completeness metrics in outbreak surveillance systems provides essential information on the availability of data for public reuse. These metadata offer important insights for public health statisticians and modelers to precisely monitor and track the geographic spread, event duration, and illness intensity of foodborne outbreaks.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Syndromic surveillance has been widely adopted as a real-time monitoring tool for timely response to disease outbreaks. During the second wave of the pH1N1 pandemic in Fall 2009, two major universities in Washington, DC collected data that were potentially indicative of influenza-like illness (ILI) cases in students and staff. In this study, our objectives were three-fold. The primary goal of this study was to characterize the impact of pH1N1 on the campuses as clearly as possible given the data available and their likely biases. In addition, we sought to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the data series themselves, in order to inform these two universities and other institutions of higher education (IHEs) about real-time surveillance systems that are likely to provide the most utility in future outbreaks (at least to the extent that it is possible to generalize from this analysis)., METHODS: We collected a wide variety of data that covered both student ILI cases reported to medical and non-medical staff, employee absenteeism, and hygiene supply distribution records (from University A only). Communication data were retrieved from university broadcasts, university preparedness websites, and H1N1-related on campus media reports. Regional data based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (CDC ILINet) surveillance network, American College Health Association (ACHA) pandemic influenza surveillance data, and local Google Flu Trends were used as external data sets. We employed a "triangulation" approach for data analysis in which multiple contemporary data sources are compared to identify time patterns that are likely to reflect biases as well as those that are more likely to be indicative of actual infection rates., RESULTS: Medical personnel observed an early peak at both universities immediately after school began in early September and a second peak in early November; only the second peak corresponded to patterns in the community at large. Self-reported illness to university deans' offices was also relatively increased during mid-term exam weeks. The overall volume of pH1N1-related communication messages similarly peaked twice, corresponding to the two peaks of student ILI cases., CONCLUSIONS: During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, both University A and B experienced a peak number of ILI cases at the beginning of the Fall term. This pattern, seen in surveillance systems at these universities and to a lesser extent in data from other IHEs, most likely resulted from students bringing the virus back to campus from their home states coupled with a sudden increase in population density in dormitories and lecture halls. Through comparison of data from different syndromic surveillance data streams, paying attention to the likely biases in each over time, we have determined, at least in the case of the pH1N1 pandemic, that student health center data more accurately depicted disease transmission on campus at both universities during the Fall 2009 pandemic than other available data sources.}

Results: A total of 499 421 case cards of brucellosis were reported during this period with an average increase rate of 6.14\%. The overall timely reporting rate was 95.97\%, the timely reporting rate increased gradually from 61.90\% in 2005 to 99.47\% in 2017. The median interval between diagnosis and reporting was 0.08 d (1.92 h). The overall timely verifying rate was 99.41\%, the timely verifying rate increased gradually from 95.25\% in 2005 to 99.70\% in 2017. The overall accuracy rate of the reporting cards was 99.86\%, the accuracy rate increased with year and reached 100.00\% during 2015-2017. Most case reporting cards were from northern China (98.22\%), but the annual case reporting cards from southern China showed an increasing trend. There was some delay in the timely case reporting in northern China, and the timely verifying rate in southern China was slightly lower. Untimely and inaccurate reporting of brucellosis cases mainly occurred in provinces with high-incidences of brucellosis, such as Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, and Hebei. Conclusion: During 2005-2017, the quality of internet based reporting of brucellosis in China were improved obviously, resulting in better reflection of the epidemic trend of brucellosis in China, however, the problems of untimely and inaccurate reporting still existed, especially in northern China. It is necessary to conduct serial training on brucellosis reporting standards, strengthen the supervision of the reporting quality and optimize the reporting items in surveillance system to further improve the quality of the internet based brucellosis reporting in China.},

  abstract = {Objective: To provide scientific basis for further prevention and control of measles outbreak by means of analyzing the epidemiological characteristics of measles outbreak and evaluating the operation condition of measles surveillance system (MSS) in Jieyang city from 2011 to 2013. Methods: Reported data of measles cases surveillance in all counties/districts of Jieyang city from 2011 to 2013 was collected and analyzed via descriptive epidemiology. Statistical analysis was conducted on the epidemiological characteristics of measles outbreak and the results of immunology for the mentioned three years. Each indice of the running condition of MSS was evaluated. Results: A total number of 167 measles cases (155 cases in laboratory diagnosis and 12 cases in clinical diagnosis) were reported in Jieyang from 2011 to 2013. The data showed that the incidence rate of exclude cases were 0.29 per 100 000, 2.57 per 100 000 and 2.18 per 100 000, respectively. No death case and epidemic outbreak. The onset of measles mainly took place during June to August, and the main affected people were the age groups between 8-month old to 14 years old and people with no measles immunization or immunization unclear. There was a steady improvement of the operation condition indice in Jieyang for the recent three years. Both indices on Timeliness and Specificity of MSS were over 90\% in 2012 and 2013. Conclusion: Weaknesses still exist in regular work of immunization. Therefore, more work should be taken to strengthen the regular basis of immunization, to conduct timely catch-up vaccination and to keep improving the sensitivity of MSS.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Monitoring hepatitis B surveillance data is important for evaluating progress towards global hepatitis B elimination goals. Accurate classification of acute and chronic hepatitis infections is essential for assessing program effectiveness., METHODS: We evaluated hepatitis B case-reporting at six hospitals in Fujian, Hainan and Gansu provinces in 2015 to assess the accuracy of case classification. We linked National Notifiable Disease Reporting System (NNDRS) HBV case-reports with hospital information systems and extracted information on age, gender, admission ward and viral hepatitis diagnosis from medical records. To assess accuracy, we compared NNDRS reported case-classifications with the national HBV case definitions. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with misclassification., RESULTS: Of the 1420 HBV cases reported to NNDRS, 23 (6.5\%) of the 352 acute reports and 648 (60.7\%) of the 1068 chronic reports were correctly classified. Of the remaining, 318 (22.4\%) were misclassified and 431 (30.4\%) could not be classified due to the lack of supporting information. Based on the multivariable analysis, HBV cases reported from Hainan (aOR = 1.8; 95\% CI: 1.3-2.4) and Gansu (aOR = 12.7; 95\% CI: 7.7-20.1) along with reports from grade 2 hospitals (aOR = 1.6; 95\% CI:1.2-2.2) and those from non-HBV related departments (aOR = 5.3; 95\% CI: 4.1-7.0) were independently associated with being 'misclassified' in NNDRS., CONCLUSIONS: We identified discrepancies in the accuracy of HBV case-reporting in the project hospitals. Onsite training on the use of anti-HBc IgM testing as well as on HBV case definitions and reporting procedures are needed to accurately assess program effectiveness and ensure case-patients are referred to appropriate treatment and care. Routine surveillance evaluations such as this can be useful for improving data quality and monitoring program effectiveness.},

  abstract = {AIM: To establish a comprehensive index system which is suitable for evaluating the effectiveness of malaria surveillance schemes., METHODS: Delphi method was used to screen the existed effectiveness evaluation indices by experts to determine key indices and weighted coefficients., RESULTS: Three indices, i.e. autochthonous incidence, ratio of cases detected (ROCD) and ratio of introduced/imported cases were selected. Their weighted coefficients were 0.36, 0.31 and 0.33, respectively. An index system named the malaria surveillance effectiveness index (MSEI) was built up and formulated as [formula: see text] which was applied to study cost-effectiveness of the two malaria surveillance schemes (A and B). According to the formula, the MSEIs in the study areas using the schemes A and B were 48.56 and 45.93, respectively. However, the cost for increasing a score of MSEI by implementing the scheme A was four times as high as that by implementing the scheme B., CONCLUSION: The MSEI is practicable for evaluating the overall effectiveness of malaria surveillance schemes, especially in the cost-effectiveness analysis and health-economic evaluation.},

  abstract = {Objective: To adjust the national disease surveillance points system (DSPs) and evaluate its representativeness. Methods: The census data in 2000 and nationwide county survey data were used to evaluate the representativeness of national DSPs adjusted in 1989. U test was used to compare the GDP per capita, the proportion of non-agricultural population, the illiteracy rate of the people aged over 15, the proportion of 0-14 years old people and the proportion of {$\geq$}65 years old people in total population, mortality rate, birth rate in the areas in DSPs with corresponding area in the country, and the DSPs was adjusted according to the evaluation results. The counties in the country were divided into 54 strata based on the indicators of geographic characteristics, economics and population. The actual county number in each stratum was used to determine the theoretical county number in each stratum in DSPs, and then the number and distribution of the surveillance points in current DSPs were adjusted. The representative evaluation was conducted again after the system adjustment. Results: One or more indicators were significant different between the rural and urban areas, eastern central and western urban areas, as well as the western rural areas in national DSPs and the corresponding areas in the country, Adjusted national DSPs includes 161 counties/districts (63 districts and 98 counties). The representative evaluation results indicated that there was no significant difference of on the indicators between urban areas, rural areas, eastern central and western urban areas and rural areas in national DSPs and the corresponding areas in the country except the total indicator of urban and rural area. Conclusion: Adjusted national DSPs has good representativeness both in urban and rural areas. The estimation of country level should correct the proportions of urban area and rural to reflect the national level.},

The nine indices were completeness of information on the reporting form, coverage of the reporting system, accessibility of criteria or guidelines for diagnosis, education and training for physicians, completeness of the reporting system, statistical methods, investigation of special cases, release of monitoring information, and release of early warning information., RESULTS: According to the evaluation, the occupational disease reporting system in China had a score of 5.5 in monitoring existing occupational diseases with a low score for release of monitoring information; the reporting system had a score of 6.5 in early warning of newly occurring occupational diseases with low scores for education and training for physicians as well as completeness of the reporting system., CONCLUSION: The occupational disease reporting system in China still does not have full function in monitoring and early warning. It is the education and participation of physicians from general hospitals in the diagnosis and treatment of occupational diseases and suspected occupational diseases that need to be enhanced. In addition, the problem of monitoring the incidence of occupational diseases needs to be solved as soon as possible.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Vaccines safety are monitored by looking for Adverse Events Following Immunizations (AEFIs). A review of the 2014 Harare City consolidated monthly return form (T5) revealed that 28 AEFIs were seen in 2014. However, only 21 were reported through the system. We therefore evaluated the Harare City AEFI surveillance system to assess its usefulness., METHODS: A descriptive cross sectional study was conducted. Twenty one of 41 clinics were randomly selected and 51 health workers were randomly recruited. Interviewer administered questionnaires were used to collect data. Epi info 7 was used to generate frequencies, means and proportions., RESULTS: Out of 51 respondents, 50 (98\%) knew the purpose of AEFI system, 48 (94\%) knew at least two presenting symptoms of AEFIs and 39 (77\%) knew the correct date of form submission to the next level. Receiving no feedback 24 (47.1\%), fear of victimisation 16 (31.4\%) and work overload 11 (21.6\%) were the major reasons for under reporting. Eighty six percent perceived the system to be simple and 43 (84\%) were willing to continue participating. Fifty three percent (27) reported taking public health actions (such as awareness campaigns \& making follow ups) basing on AEFI data collected. All 46 reviewed forms were completely filled and submitted in time. All 21 clinics had written AEFI guidelines and case definitions. Only 14 of 21 clinics had adequately stocked emergency drugs. The total cost for a single notification was estimated at US\$22.30., CONCLUSION: The system was useful, simple, acceptable, timely, stable, representative but costly. The good performance of the system reported in this evaluation could be attributed to high health worker knowledge. Following this evaluation, replenishment of out of stock drugs and follow up of missing 2014 AEFI feedback from MCAZ were done. In addition, making the system electronic is recommended.},
