Evaluating bias in surveillance systems is essential for accurately monitoring endemic diseases.","Evaluating case detection bias (also called ascertainment bias) involves assessing systematic errors that affect a surveillance system's ability to accurately identify and classify cases or events. This includes selection bias (when certain cases or populations are systematically over- or under-represented) and information bias (when data collection methods systematically affect measurement accuracy). Bias represents the consequence of measurement errors that can be characterized through surveillance performance measures such as sensitivity, specificity, and representativeness.
Evaluating bias involves assessing potential sources, such as diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, underreporting in passive surveillance, and how the sample population is chosen (e.g., animals from abattoirs might not represent the overall population). Additionally, geographic, demographic, or ecological factors can contribute to bias. To quantify and correct for bias, methods like comparison across multiple data sources, simulation models, statistical methods, or capture-recapture analyses can be used. 

Assessment of bias (systematic error) should address the following:

It is related to sampling strategy, reporting completeness, and access to high-risk populations. Mathematically, coverage is the proportion the same represents divided by the total target population size.","Coverage was identified as a reported concept six times in our scoping review. The concept was first introduced by Hoinville et al., in 2013 and has since been consistently included in animal health surveillance system evaluation frameworks. The definition has remained highly consistent within animal health surveillance, aligning with the concept of ""population coverage"" in public health surveillance.","Coverage can be assessed by the proportion of respondents (survey-based) or cases (hospital- or facility-based) included in the surveillance system. Key measurements include population undercoverage, which occurs when parts of the target population are missed, and population overcoverage, where elements outside the target population are included. A demographic analysis can provide benchmarks for assessing completeness of coverage in the existing surveillance data and document changes in coverage from previous periods. Additionally, systems like farmer-based clinical surveillance, syndromic surveillance, or periodic sampling surveys benefit from regular evaluations to identify gaps or misrepresentation in coverage. By reviewing the geographic coverage and the number of areas of interest, it is easier to determine if the surveillance system adequately represents the target population. Furthermore, temporal coverage can be assess by determining the conditional probability that any given unit in the population will be examined or tested within the specified time frame. For example, if the target time frame is 7 days, but testing occurs every 4 weeks, the temporal coverage would be 25%. An assessment of coverage could include: * Characterisation and qualitative comparison of the sampled and target populations. Alternatively, comparison of sampled areas or habitats versus areas or habitats of interest. * Where sufficient data on the target population/areas or habitats of interest exists, simple calculations of the proportional coverage can be made (e.g. 75% of the national herd and 45% of cattle holdings are sampled annually or 30% of the marine ports). * Where sufficient information on the background population, or high-risk areas or habitats respectively, is lacking, more sophisticated sampling designs might be employed (e.g. capture-recapture analysis or drop camera surveillance). * Considering whether the target population, or area of interest, has been adequately defined (i.e. whether the exclusion of certain animals or holdings or sites is merited). * The unit of interest - the level at which coverage is measured - is often the unit of interest of surveillance (e.g. animal, holding, high-risk site or specific marine habitat). If insufficient data exist, alternative perspectives might be desired. Coverage might then be assessed at other aggregate levels (e.g. geographical areas) or relevant intermediate steps in the surveillance pathway (e.g. the proportion of veterinary practices submitting diagnostic samples). * In certain contexts it may be worth establishing a timeframe of reference (e.g. annual coverage). The choice of timeframe should reflect the epidemiology of the disease or life history of a risk organism.","Representativeness and coverage separate for scoping, maybe combine for Delphi?

Validity may be estimated by the proportion of errors in surveillance system data compared to analogous data from one of the system's data sources. Measures for determining data quality include percentages of ""unknown,"" invalid, and missing responses to items on data collection forms. In addition, data quality can be measured by applying edits for consistency in the data. However, a full assessment may require a special study. The acceptability and representativeness of a public health surveillance system are related to data quality. With data of high quality, the system can be accepted by those who participate in it. In addition, the system can accurately represent the health-related event under surveillance. Paper-based systems, such as the E-Book registry, are more prone to human error, and can result in illegible, missing, and incomplete entries. An electronic system could increase data quality. Moreover, conversion to an electronic system would improve the timeliness, accessibility, and usability of captured data, as well as allow greater flexibility in responding to health events in a community. Many data-quality definitions depend on other system performance attributes (eg, timeliness, usefulness, acceptability) (21). Because of reliance on multiple data sources, data quality must be assessed in different ways. For surveillance relying on surveys, concepts of reliability, validity, and comparison with alternative data sources are important. For example, considerations of possible data-quality concerns arise with use of mortality data, particularly underreporting of suicide. It should be assessed using measures of completeness, consistency, and comparison with alternative sources to ensure reliability across diverse data types and collection methods.","To report separately for the scoping review.

PPV is influenced by the specificity and sensitivity of case definitions, as well as the prevalence of the condition in the population. As sensitivity and PPV approach 100%, a system is more likely to be representative of the population with the event under surveillance.

In this report, PVP is represented by A/(A+B) (Table 3). Evaluating Positive Predictive Value (PVP) involves assessing the accuracy of case detection and outbreak identification based on reported data. This can be done on two levels: individual case detection and epidemic detection. For case detection, the PVP is determined by confirming reported cases through investigation and comparing the number of true cases to the total number of reported cases. This requires keeping records of all interventions triggered by the surveillance system, such as the number of case investigations conducted and the proportion of cases confirmed. For epidemic detection, the PVP is assessed by evaluating the proportion of detected outbreaks that are true epidemics. This can involve reviewing personnel activity reports, travel records, and telephone logbooks to determine if resources are being misdirected due to false-positive case reports. Additionally, external data sources, such as medical records or registries, may be used to validate reported cases and improve the accuracy of PVP calculations. To obtain a comprehensive understanding, it may be necessary to assess PVP for different data sources, system data fields, and specific health-related events.

It is demonstrated through real-world outcomes, such as policy changes, early outbreak detection, or targeted interventions. Usefulness depends on how well outputs meet stakeholder needs and influence decision-making. Retrospective analysis and stakeholder input help assess alignment with health priorities.
