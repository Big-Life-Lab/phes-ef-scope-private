In Table 1 this is represented by A/(A+B). , ,,"In assessing PVP, primary emphasis is placed on the confirmation of cases reported through the surveillance system. Its effect on the use of public health resources can be considered on two levels. At the level of an individual case, PVP affects the amount of resources used for case investigations. For example, in some states every reported case of type A hepatitis is promptly investigated by a public health nurse, and family members at risk are referred for prophylactic treatment with immune globulin. A surveillance system with low PVP--and therefore frequent ""false-positive"" case reports--would lead to wasted resources.

The other level is that of detection of epidemics. A high rate of erroneous case reports may trigger an inappropriate outbreak investigation. Therefore, the proportion of epidemics identified by the surveillance system that are true epidemics is needed to assess this attribute.

Calculating the PVP may require that records be kept of all interventions initiated because of information obtained from the surveillance system. A record of the number of case investigations done and the proportion of persons who actually had the condition under surveillance would allow the calculation of the PVP at the level of case detection. Personnel activity reports, travel records, and telephone logbooks may all be useful in estimating the PVP at the epidemic detection level.","PVP is important because a low value means that a) non-cases are being investigated and b) epidemics may be mistakenly identified. PFalse-positiveP' reports may lead to unnecessary intervention, and falsely detected PepidemicsP' may lead to costly investigations and undue concern in the community. A surveillance system with high PVP will lead to fewer wild-goose chases and wasted resources.

An example of a surveillance evaluation that examined PVP was reported by Barker et al. They reviewed hospital charts to determine the proportion of persons admitted with a diagnosis of stroke who had the diagnosis confirmed (6). Of 1,604 patients admitted to seven acute-care hospitals with a stroke-related diagnosis, 903 (PVP = 56%) were subsequently confirmed to have had strokes.

The PVP for a health event is closely related to the clarity and specificity of the case definition. Good communication between the persons who report cases and the receiving agency also can improve PVP.

The PVP reflects the sensitivity and specificity of the case definition and the prevalence of the condition in the population (Table 1).

Although the latter information is generally not known, some judgment of the representativeness of surveillance data is possible, based on knowledge of:
a. Characteristics of the population--e.g., age, socioeconomic status, geographic location (5);
b. Natural history of the condition--e.g., latency period, mode of transmission, fatal outcome;
c. Prevailing medical practices--e.g., sites performing diagnostic tests, physician-referral patterns (7,8);
d. Multiple sources of data--e.g., mortality rates for comparison with incidence data, laboratory reports for comparison with physician reports. Representativeness can be examined through special studies that seek to identify a probability sample of all cases.

Quality of data is an important part of representativeness. Much of the discussion in this document focuses on the identification and classification of cases. However, most surveillance systems rely on more than simple case counts. Information commonly collected includes the demographic characteristics of affected persons, details about the health event, and notification of the presence or absence of potential risk factors.
The quality and usefulness and representativeness of this information depends on its completeness and validity.

Quality of data is influenced by the clarity of surveillance forms, the quality of training and supervision of persons who complete surveillance forms, and the care exercised in data management. A review of these facets of a surveillance system provides an indirect measure of quality of data. Examining the percentage of unknown or blank responses to items on surveillance forms or questionnaires is straightforward.Assessing the reliability and validity of responses would require such special studies as chart reviews or re-interviews of respondents.","In order to generalize findings from surveillance data to the population at large, the data from a surveillance system should reflect the population characteristics that are important to the goals and objectives of that system. These characteristics generally relate to time, place, and person. An important result of evaluating the representativeness of a surveillance system is the identification of population subgroups that may be systematically excluded from the reporting system. This process allows appropriate modification of data collection and more accurate projection of incidence of the health event in the target population.

For example, an evaluation of reporting of hepatitis in a county in Washington State suggested that cases of type B hepatitis were under-reported among homosexual males and that cases of type non A-non B hepatitis were under-reported among persons given blood transfusions. The importance of these risk factors as contributors to the occurrence of these diseases was apparently underestimated by the selective under-reporting of certain types of hepatitis cases (9).

Errors and bias can make their way into a surveillance system at any stage. Because surveillance data are used to identify high-risk groups, to target interventions, and to evaluate interventions, it is important to be aware of the strengths and limitations of the information in the system.

So far the discussion of attributes has been aimed at the information collected for cases, but in many surveillance systems morbidity and mortality rates are calculated. The denominators for these rate calculations are often obtained from a completely separate data system maintained by another agency, e.g., the Bureau of the Census. Thought should be given to the comparability of categories (e.g., race, age, residence) on which the numerators and denominators of rate calculations are based.",N/A,,,N/A,representativeness,representativeness,Functional attributes,Inclusion attributes,Representativeness,representativeness,Pending,Pending,Surveillance effectiveness,System performance,Equity-related,N/A,bias

Second, the system can be evaluated for its ability to detect epidemics (3). ", ,,"The sensitivity of a surveillance system is affected by the likelihood that:
a. Persons with certain diseases or health conditions seek medical care;
b. The diseases or conditions will be diagnosed, reflecting the skill of care providers and the sensitivity of diagnostic tests; and
c. The case will be reported to the system, given the diagnosis. These three conditions can be extended by analogy to surveillance systems that do not fit the traditional disease care-provider model. For example, the sensitivity of a telephone-based surveillance system of morbidity or risk factors is affected by:
a. The number of people who have telephones, who are at home when the call is placed, and who agree to participate;
b. The ability of persons to understand the questions and correctly identify their status; and
c. The willingness of respondents to report their status. The extent to which these questions are explored depends on the system and on the resources available for the evaluation. The measurement of sensitivity in a surveillance system requires a) the validation of information collected by the system and b) the collection of information external to the system to determine the frequency of the condition in a community (4). From a practical standpoint, the primary emphasis in assessing sensitivity--assuming that most reported cases are correctly classified--is to estimate the proportion of the total number of cases in the community being detected by the system","A surveillance system that does not have high sensitivity can still be useful in monitoring trends, as long as the sensitivity remains reasonably constant. Questions concerning sensitivity in surveillance systems most commonly arise when changes in disease occurrence are noted. Changes in sensitivity can be precipitated by such events as heightened awareness of a disease, introduction of new diagnostic tests, and changes in the method of conducting surveillance. A search for such surveillance ""artifacts"" is often an initial step in outbreak investigations.

As sensitivity and PVP approach 100%, a surveillance system is more likely to be representative of the population being monitored. However, as sensitivity increases, PVP may decrease. Efforts to increase sensitivity and PVP tend to make a surveillance system more complex--potentially decreasing its acceptability, timeliness, and flexibility. For example, a study comparing health-department-initiated (active) surveillance and provider-initiated (passive) surveillance did not improve timeliness, despite increased sensitivity (8)",N/A,,,recall,sensitivity,sensitivity,Effectiveness attributes,Evidence quality attributes,Sensitivity,sensitivity,Pending,Pending,Surveillance effectiveness,Data quality,Ascertainment performance,N/A,Pending

A more complex system might involve some of the following:
a. Special laboratory tests to confirm the case
b. Telephone contact or a home visit by a public health nurse to collect detailed information
c. Multiple levels of reporting (e.g., with the Notifiable Diseases Reporting System, case reports may start with the doctor who makes the diagnosis and pass through county and state health departments before going to the Centers for Disease Control) Simplicity is closely related to timeliness and will affect the amount of resources that are required to operate the system",N/A,,,N/A,simplicity,simplicity,Functional attributes,System function attributes,Simplicity,simplicity,Pending,Pending,Integration and stability,Resiliency,N/A,N/A,Pending

The time interval linking any two of the steps in this figure can be examined. The interval usually considered first is the amount of time between the onset of an adverse health event and the report of the event to the public health agency responsible for instituting control and prevention measures. Another aspect of timeliness is the time required for the identification of trends, outbreaks, or the effect of control measures. With acute diseases, the onset of symptoms is usually used. Sometimes the date of exposure is used. With chronic diseases, it may be more useful to look at elapsed time from diagnosis rather than to estimate an onset date. ","The timeliness of a surveillance system should be evaluated in terms of availability of information for disease control--either for immediate control efforts or for long-term program planning.

For example, a study of a surveillance system for Shigella infections indicated that the typical case of shigellosis was brought to the attention of health officials 11 days after onset of symptoms--a period sufficient for the occurrence of secondary and tertiary transmission. This suggests that the level of timeliness was not satisfactory for effective disease control (10). In contrast, when there is a long period oflatency between exposure and appearance of disease, the rapid identification of cases of illness may not be as important as the rapid availability of exposure data to provide a basis for interrupting and preventing exposures that lead to disease. In another time frame, surveillance data are being used by public health agencies to track progress toward the 1990 Objectives for the Nation and to plan for the Year 2000 Objectives.

The need for rapidity of response in a surveillance system depends on the nature of the public health problem under surveillance and the objectives of that system. Recently, computer technology has been integrated into surveillance systems and may promote timeliness (11,12)

Detect trends signaling changes in the occurrence of disease?
Detect epidemics?
Provide estimates of the magnitude of morbidity and mortality related to the health problem under surveillance?

The measure can be qualitative, in terms of the subjective views of those using the system, or quantitative in terms of the impact of surveillance data on policies, interventions or the occurrence of a health event. 

The simplest way to assess usefulness is to ask those involved in public health practice. Surveys of public health officials at the state and local level, for example, have indicated that routine notifiable disease reports for viral hepatitis and measles are useful for disease prevention and control (18~ 19), A more rigorous approach 
to defining usefulness is through assessment of the impact of surveillance data on policies and interventions, and ultimately their impact on the occurrence of a health event. While policy analyses have been conducted 
elsewhere in the health field (20), there are no such studies of surveillance systems. Such policy analysis requires both observation and understanding of the decision-making process and quantification of the impact of surveillance information on the measures of interest (i.e. 
morbidity, mortality, disability and quality of life). The latter can be accomplished by a quantifiable score such as the Disease Impact Score, which expresses as a single index the estimated impact of prevention on morbidity, mortality and cost, and attributes a portion of that score to surveillance (21). Although surveillance data 
may be important to health decision making and policy formation, decisions affecting surveillance are often based on changes in more general programme directions rather than detailed analysis of a particular system (e.g. directing resources away from routine contact tracing for gonorrhoea control to programmes for the prevention and control of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) . 
","An additional consideration is the extent to which the knowledge obtained from surveillance data about the epidemiology of a health event leads to better understanding of a health problem (e.g. the identification of foreign travel as a risk factor in disease transmission), Even a very crude system of surveillance may be useful to public health practitioners (e.g. counting the total number of deaths seen by a medical examiner during a heat wave). 

The usefulness of a surveillance system should be reviewed periodically as illness patterns change and new priorities emerge. If a system is not directed towards high-priority health events and used as a tool to drive public health activities, either efforts must be made to 
improve the surveillance system or these resources should be directed elsewhere. ","We recommend that the evaluation of the usefulness of a surveillance system be based on answers to the following questions. Does the system : 
* detect trends signalling new problems and lead to control and prevention activities? 
* detect epidemics leading to control and prevention activities? 
* provide quantitative estimates of the magnitude of morbidity and mortalitY related to the health event under surveillance? 
* identify factors involved in disease occurrence? 
* facilitate research likely to lead to control or prevention?

Sensitivity has often been viewed as completeness of reporting, especially for notifiable diseases. In fact, the need for completeness is often considered so important that considerable cost, time, and energy are expended in attaining this goal. However, a surveillance system that does not have high completeness can be sensitive, as long as the reporting fraction remains reasonably constant. Indeed, for relatively common conditions, achieving high completeness of reporting may be expensive and accomplishes little. 

Completeness becomes a more important consideration for very uncommon diseases (e.g., Reye syndrome) or when, as a control measure progresses, a common disease becomes rare. In these situations, one purpose of surveillance is case-finding and completeness becomes synonymous with sensitivity.

The people responsible for a surveillance system should be aware of and know why underreporting occurs (e.g., asymptomatic cases, inadequate data sources, case definition requirements. For notifiable diseases, the reasons for underreporting that can be corrected include: lack of knowledge of the reporting requirement (e.g., unaware of which disease must be reported, or how or to whom to report); negative attitude towards reporting (time-consuming, too difficult, lack of incentive, lack of feedback, or distrust of the government); and misconceptions that result from lack of knowledge or a negative attitude (concern about confidentiality, or the disease is not regarded as serious, or the perception that the health department does not use or value reports).

In addition, the calculation of sensitivity (Task D.2.e) and predictive value positive (Task D.2.f) for the system's data fields might be useful in assessing data quality.

An important characteristic of CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is its flexibility (39 ). Conducted in collaboration with state health departments, BRFSS is an ongoing sample survey that gathers and reports state-level prevalence data on health behaviors related to the leading preventable causes of death as well as data on preventive health practices. The system permits states to add questions of their own design to the BRFSS questionnaire but is uniform enough to allow state-to-state comparisons for certain questions.

Depending on the objectives of the public health surveillance system, assessing PVP whenever sensitivity has been assessed might be necessary (47-50,53 ). In this report, PVP is represented by A/(A+B) (Table 3).

In assessing PVP, primary emphasis is placed on the confirmation of cases reported through the surveillance system. The effect of PVP on the use of public health resources can be considered on two levels. At the level of case detection, PVP affects the amount of resources used for case investigations. For example, in some states, every reported case of type A hepatitis is promptly investigated by a public health nurse, and contacts at risk are referred for prophylactic treatment. A surveillance system with low PVP, and therefore frequent ""false-positive"" case reports, would lead to misdirected resources.

At the level of outbreak (or epidemic) detection, a high rate of erroneous case reports might trigger an inappropriate outbreak investigation. Therefore, the proportion of epidemics identified by the surveillance system that are true epidemics can be used to assess this attribute.

Calculating the PVP might require that records be kept of investigations prompted by information obtained from the public health surveillance system. At the level of case detection, a record of the number of case investigations completed and the proportion of reported persons who actually had the health-related event under surveillance would allow the calculation of the PVP. At the level of outbreak detection, the review of personnel activity reports, travel records, and telephone logbooks might enable the assessment of PVP. For some surveillance systems, however, a review of data external to the system (e.g., medical records) might be necessary to confirm cases to calculate PVP. Examples of data sources used to assess the PVP of health information or public health surveillance systems include medical records (48,57 ), registries (49,58 ), and death certificates (59 ).

To assess the PVP of the system adequately, calculating more than one measurement of the attribute might be necessary. For example, PVP could be determined for the system's data fields, for each data source or combinations of data sources (48 ), or for specific health-related events (49 ).","PVP is important because a low value means that noncases might beinvestigated, and outbreaks might be identified that are not true but are instead artifacts of the public health surveillance system (e.g., a ""pseudo-outbreak""). False-positive reports can lead to unnecessary interventions, and falsely detected outbreaks can lead to costly investigations and undue concern in the population under surveillance. A public health surveillance system with a high PVP will lead to fewer misdirected resources.

The PVP reflects the sensitivity and specificity of the case definition (i.e., the screening and diagnostic tests for the health-related event) and the prevalence of the health-related event in the population under surveillance. The PVP can improve with increasing specificity of the case definition. In addition, good communication between the persons who report cases and the receiving agency can lead to an improved PVP.",N/A,,,Precision,positivePredicitiveValue,positivePredicitiveValue,Effectiveness attributes,Evidence quality attributes,Predictive Value Positive (PVP),predictive value positive (PVP),Pending,Pending,Surveillance effectiveness,Data quality,Ascertainment performance,N/A,Pending

Although the latter information is generally not known, some judgment of the representativeness of surveillance data is possible, based on knowledge of
* characteristics of the population, including, age, socioeconomic status, access to health care, and geographic location (60 );
* clinical course of the disease or other health-related event (e.g., latency period, mode of transmission, and outcome [e.g., death, hospitalization, or disability]);
* prevailing medical practices (e.g., sites performing diagnostic tests and physician-referral patterns) (33,61 ); and
* multiple sources of data (e.g., mortality rates for comparison with incidence data and laboratory reports for comparison with physician reports).

Representativeness can be examined through special studies that seek to identify a sample of all cases. For example, the representativeness of a regional injury surveillance system was examined using a systematic sample of injured persons (62 ). The study examined statistical measures of population variables (e.g., age, sex, residence, nature of injury, and hospital admission) and concluded that the differences in the distribution of injuries in the system's database and their distribution in the sampled data should not affect the ability of the surveillance system to achieve its objectives.

For many health-related events under surveillance, the proper analysis and interpretation of the data require the calculation of rates. The denominators for these rate calculations are often obtained from a completely separate data system maintained by another agency (e.g., the United States Bureau of the Census in collaboration with state governments [63 ]). The choice of an appropriate denominator for the rate calculation should be given careful consideration to ensure an accurate representation of the health-related event over time and by place and person. For example, numerators and denominators must be comparable across categories (e.g., race [64 ], age, residence, and/or time period), and the source for the denominator should be consistent over time when measuring trends in rates. In addition, consideration should be given to the selection of the standard population for the adjustment of rates (65 )","To generalize findings from surveillance data to the population at large, the data from a public health surveillance system should accurately reflect the characteristics of the health-related event under surveillance. These characteristics generally relate to time, place, and person. An important result of evaluating the representativeness of a surveillance system is the identification of population subgroups that might be systematically excluded from the reporting system through inadequate methods of monitoring them. This evaluation process enables appropriate modification of data collection procedures and more accurate projection of incidence of the health-related event in the target population (66 ).

For certain health-related events, the accurate description of the event over time involves targeting appropriate points in a broad spectrum of exposure and the resultant disease or condition. In the surveillance of cardiovascular diseases, for example, it might be useful to distinguish between preexposure conditions (e.g., tobacco use policies and social norms), the exposure (e.g., tobacco use, diet, exercise, stress, and genetics), a pre-symptomatic phase (e.g., cholesterol and homocysteine levels), earlystaged disease (e.g., abnormal stress test), late-staged disease (e.g., angina and acute myocardial infarction), and death from the disease. The measurement of risk factor behaviors (e.g., tobacco use) might enable the monitoring of important aspects in the development of a disease or other health-related event.

Because surveillance data are used to identify groups at high risk and to target and evaluate interventions, being aware of the strengths and limitations of the system's data is important. Errors and bias can be introduced into the system at any stage (67 ).
For example, case ascertainment (or selection) bias can result from changes in reporting practices over time or from differences in reporting practices by geographic location or by health-care providers. Differential reporting among population subgroups can result in misleading conclusions about the health-related event under surveillance.",N/A,,,N/A,representativeness,representativeness,Functional attributes,Inclusion attributes,Representativeness,representativeness,Pending,Pending,Surveillance effectiveness,System performance,Equity-related,N/A,bias

* certain diseases or other health-related events are occurring in the population under surveillance;
* cases of certain health-related events are under medical care, receive laboratory testing, or are otherwise coming to the attention of institutions subject to reporting requirements;
* the health-related events will be diagnosed/identified, reflecting the skill of health-care providers and the sensitivity of screening and diagnostic tests (i.e., the case definition); and
* the case will be reported to the system.
These situations can be extended by analogy to public health surveillance systems that do not fit the traditional disease care-provider model. For example, the sensitivity of a telephone-based surveillance system of morbidity or risk factors is affected by
* the number of persons who have telephones, who are at home when the call is placed, and who agree to participate;
* the ability of persons to understand the questions and correctly identify their status; and
* the willingness of respondents to report their status.
The extent to which these situations are explored depends on the system and on the resources available for assessing sensitivity. The primary emphasis in assessing sensitivity — assuming that most reported cases are correctly classified — is to estimate the proportion of the total number of cases in the population under surveillance being detected by the system, represented by A/(A+C) in this report (Table 3).

Approaches that have been recommended for improving sensitivity of reporting vaccine-preventable diseases might be applicable to other health-related events (44 ). For example, the sensitivity of a system might be improved by
* conducting active surveillance (i.e., contacting all providers and institutions responsible for reporting cases);
* using external standards (or other surveillance indicators) to monitor the quality of case reporting;
* identifying imported cases;
* tracking the number of cases of suspected disease that are reported, investigated, and ruled out as cases;
* monitoring the diagnostic effort (e.g., tracking submission of laboratory requests for diagnostic testing); and
* monitoring the circulation of the agent (e.g., virus or bacterium) that causes the disease.

The capacity for a public health surveillance system to detect outbreaks (or other changes in incidence and prevalence) might be enhanced substantially if detailed diagnostic tests are included in the system. For example, the use of molecular subtyping in the surveillance of Escherichia coli O157:H7 infections in Minnesota enabled the surveillance system to detect outbreaks that would otherwise have gone unrecognized (45 ).
The measurement of the sensitivity of the surveillance system (Table 3) requires
a) collection of or access to data usually external to the system to determine the true frequency of the condition in the population under surveillance (46 ) and b) validation of the data collected by the system. Examples of data sources used to assess the sensitivity of health information or public health surveillance systems include medical records (47,48 ) and registries (49,50 ). In addition, sensitivity can be assessed through estimations of the total cases in the population under surveillance by using capture-recapture techniques (51,52 ).
To adequately assess the sensitivity of the public health surveillance system, calculating more than one measurement of the attribute might be necessary. For example, sensitivity could be determined for the system's data fields, for each data source or for combinations of data sources (48 ), for specific conditions under surveillance (53 ), or for each of several years (54 ). The use of a Venn diagram might help depict measurements of sensitivity for combinations of the system's data sources (55 ).","A literature review can be helpful in determining sensitivity measurements for a public health surveillance system (56 ). The assessment of the sensitivity of each data source, including combinations of data sources, can determine if the elimination of a current data source or if the addition of a new data source would affect the overall surveillance results (48 ).

A public health surveillance system that does not have high sensitivity can still be useful in monitoring trends as long as the sensitivity remains reasonably constant over time. Questions concerning sensitivity in surveillance systems most commonly arise when changes in the occurrence of a health-related event are noted. Changes in sensitivity can be precipitated by some circumstances (e.g., heightened awareness of a health-related event, introduction of new diagnostic tests, and changes in the method of conducting surveillance).

A more complex system might involve some of the following:
* special or follow-up laboratory tests to confirm the case;
* investigation of the case, including telephone contact or a home visit by public health personnel to collect detailed information;
* multiple levels of reporting (e.g., with the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System, case reports might start with the health-care provider who makes the diagnosis and pass through county and state health departments before going to CDC [29 ]); and

The time interval linking any two of these steps can be examined. The interval usually considered first is the amount of time between the onset of a health-related event and the reporting of that event to the public health agency responsible for instituting control and prevention measures. Factors affecting the time involved during this interval can include the patient's recognition of symptoms, the patient's acquisition of medical care, the attending physician's diagnosis orsubmission of a laboratory test, the laboratory reporting test results back to the physician and/or to a public health agency, and the physician reporting the event to a public health agency. Another aspect of timeliness is the time required for the identification of trends, outbreaks, or the effect of control and prevention measures. Factors that influence the identification process can include the severity and communicability of the health-related event, staffing of the responsible public health agency, and communication among involved health agencies and organizations. The most relevant time interval might vary with the type of health-related event under surveillance. With acute or infectious diseases, for example, the interval from the onset of symptoms or the date of exposure might be used. With chronic diseases, it might be more useful to look at elapsed time from diagnosis rather than from the date of symptom onset.","The timeliness of a public health surveillance system should be evaluated in terms of availability of information for control of a health-related event, including immediate control efforts, prevention of continued exposure, or program planning.
The need for rapidity of response in a surveillance system depends on the nature of the health-related event under surveillance and the objectives of that system. A study of a public health surveillance system for Shigella infections, for example, indicated that the typical case of shigellosis was brought to the attention of health officials 11 days after onset of symptoms — a period sufficient for the occurrence of secondary and tertiary transmission. This example indicates that the level of timeliness was not satisfactory for effective disease control (68 ). However, when a long period of latency occurs between exposure and appearance of disease, the rapid identification of cases of illness might not be as important as the rapid availability of exposure data to provide a basis for interrupting and preventing exposures that lead to disease. For example, children with elevated blood lead levels and no clinically apparent illness are at risk for adverse health-related events. CDC recommends that follow-up of asymptomatic children with elevated blood lead levels include educational activities regarding lead poisoning prevention and investigation and remediation of sources of lead exposure (69 ).
In addition, surveillance data are being used by public health agencies to track progress toward national and state health objectives (38,70 ).

The increasing use of electronic data collection from reporting sources (e.g., an electronic laboratory-based surveillance system) and via the Internet (a web-based system), as well as the increasing use of electronic data interchange by surveillance systems, might promote timeliness (6,29,71,72 ).",N/A,,,N/A,timeliness,timeliness,Effectiveness attributes,Evidence quality attributes,Timeliness,timeliness,Pending,Pending,Surveillance effectiveness,Data quality,N/A,N/A,accessibility

Although a statistical deviation from a baseline rate can be useful for triggering further investigation, it is not sufficient for defining an outbreak. In practice, the confirmation of an outbreak is a judgment that depends on past experience with the condition, the severity of the condition, the communicability of the condition, confidence in the diagnosis of the condition, public health concern about outbreaks at the time, having options for effective prevention or control, and the resources required and available to respond. Operationally, an outbreak is defined by the affected public health jurisdiction when the occurrence of a condition has changed sufficiently to warrant public health attention.

* Case definitions: Establish the specificity and sensitivity for the condition of interest on the basis of the data source, data type, and response criteria.
* Baseline estimation: Determine the stability of the background occurrence of cases. Estimations are affected by factors such as population size and geographic distribution. The performance of detection algorithms will vary by the quality and duration and inherent variability of baseline data.
* Reporting delays: Result in incomplete data, introducing bias that will diminish the performance of detection algorithms.
* Data characteristics: Includes underlying patterns in the data (e.g., seasonal variation) and systematic errors inherent in the data (e.g., product sales that influence purchasing behaviors unrelated to illness).
* Outbreak characteristics: Results from agent, host, and environmental factors that affect the epidemiology of the outbreak. For example, a large aerosol exposure with an agent causing serious disease in a highly susceptible population will have different detection potential than an outbreak of similar size spread person-to-person over a longer time and dispersed distribution.
* Statistical analysis: Defines how data are screened for outbreak detection. Detection algorithms have different performance characteristics under different outbreak conditions.
* Epidemiologic analysis, interpretation, and investigation: The procedures, resources, and tools for analysis, interpretation, and response that can substantially affect the ability to detect and respond to outbreaks.

Standardized classification of system and outbreak factors will enable comparison of experiences across systems. Pending the development of classification standards, descriptive evaluation should include as much detail as possible. 

Different approaches to outbreak detection need to be evaluated under the same conditions to isolate the unique features of the system (e.g., data type) from the outbreak characteristics and the health department capacity. The data needed to evaluate and compare the performance of surveillance systems for early outbreak detection can be obtained from naturally occurring outbreaks or through simulation.

The measurement of outbreaks detected, false alarms, and outbreaks missed or detected late should be designed as a routine part any system workflow and conducted with minimal effort or complexity. Routine reporting should be automated where possible. Relevant information needs include: the number of statistical aberrations detected at a set threshold in a defined period of time (e.g., frequency per month at a given p-value); the action taken as a result of the signals (e.g., review for data errors, in-depth follow-up analysis of the specific conditions within the syndrome category, manual epidemiologic analysis to characterize a signal, examining data from other systems, and increasing the frequency of reporting from affected sites); resources directed to the follow-up of the alert; public health response that resulted (e.g., an alert to clinicians, timely dissemination of information to other health entities, a vaccination campaign, or no further response); documentation of how every recognized outbreak in the jurisdiction was detected; an assessment of the value of the follow-up effort (e.g., the effort was an appropriate application of public health resources); a detailed description of the agent, host, and environmental conditions of the outbreak; and the number of outbreaks detected only late in their course or in retrospect.",N/A,,,N/A,accuracy,accuracy,Functional attributes,Data quality attributes,Sensitivity,validity (data),Outbreak detection,Pending,Surveillance effectiveness,Data quality,N/A,N/A,Pending

Questions to answer include the following:
* How many investigations were initiated as a result of these data?
* What response was made and what cost was incurred through follow-up of flagged events?
* What were the indications for responding?
* How much staff time was required for follow-up?
* Was anxiety raised unnecessarily by false alarms?
* Was benefit obtained (e.g., through improved communication and confidence in the responsibility and performance of public health) when false alarms were investigated?
* Who was affected?
* What costs did partners incur in follow-up of signals (e.g., medical record staff work and clinical staff efforts)?
Follow-up costs for false alarms should be distinguished from costs related to investigations that uncover real outbreaks that warrant a public health response.
* Did the health department fail to respond to a true event because of complacency or the response burden resulting from false alarms?
* Did late recognition of an outbreak result in unnecessary morbidity?
* Have lessons learned from earlier events reduced costs as the system has continued to operate?","Cost is a vital factor in assessing the relative value of surveillance for terrorism preparedness. Cost-effectiveness analyses and data modeling are needed under a range of scenarios to estimate the value of innovations in surveillance for outbreak detection and terrorism preparedness (17). Improved methods of measuring cost and impact are needed. Costs borne by data providers should be noted; however, the cost perspective should be that of the community (societal perspective) to account for costs of prevention and treatment born by the community.The cost of responding to false alarms represents a variable but inherent inefficiency of an early detection system that should be accounted for in the evaluation. Similarly, variable costs include the financial and public health costs of missing outbreaks entirely or recognizing them late. Costs vary because the sensitivity and timeliness of the detection methods can be modified according to changes in tolerance for missing outbreaks and for responding to false alarms. Similarly, the threshold and methods for investigating system alarms can vary with the perceived risk and need to respond. Costs from public health response to false alarms with traditional surveillance systems need to be measured in a comparable way when assessing the relative value of new surveillance methods.

Although measuring all of the time points that define the intervals might be impractical or inexact in an applied outbreak setting, measuring intervals in a consistent way can be used to compare alternative outbreak-detection approaches and specific surveillance systems.","* Onset of exposure: By anchoring the timeline on exposure, the timeliness advantage of different data sources can be assessed and compared. Exposure can most easily be estimated in a point-source outbreak. Time of exposure is often inferred from knowledge of the agent (e.g., incubation period) and the epidemiology of the outbreak.

* Onset of symptoms: The interval to symptom onset in each case is defined by the incubation period for the agent. Time of symptom onset might be estimated using case interviews or existing knowledge of the agent and the time of exposure. The incubation period might vary according to host factors and the route and dose of the exposure.

* Onset of behavior: Following symptom onset, several health behaviors can occur (e.g., purchasing over-the-counter medication from a store, calling in sick to work, or visiting an urgent-care center). When an affected person interacts with the health-care system, a variety of health-care provider behaviors might be performed (e.g., order of a laboratory test and admission to a hospital).
The selection of data sources for a system has a strong influence on timeliness. Some of those experiencing symptoms will initiate a health behavior or stimulate a healthcare provider behavior that is a necessary step to being captured in the surveillance system.

* Capture of data: The timing of the capture of a behavior by the data-providing facility varies by data type and can be influenced by system design. A retail purchase might be entered in an electronic database at the moment the transaction is completed, or a record might not be generated in a clinical setting until hours after health care was sought.

* Completion of data processing: Time is required for the facility providing the data to process the data and produce the files needed for public health. Records might be transmitted to a central repository only periodically (e.g., weekly). Data form can influence processing time (e.g., transcription from paper to electronic form and coding text-based data), and data manipulations needed to de-identify data and prepare necessary files can affect processing time.

* Capture of data in public health surveillance system:
The time required to transfer data from the data providing facility to the public health entity varies according to the frequency established for routine data transmission and by the data transmission method (e.g., Internet, mail, or courier).

* Application of pattern recognition tools/algorithms:
Before analytic tools can be applied to the data in the surveillance system, certain processing steps are necessary (e.g., categorization into syndrome categories, application of case definition, and data transformations).

* Generation of automated alert: The detection algorithm's alerting interval is a product of how often the algorithm is run and a report generated and the capacity of the algorithm to filter noise and detect an aberration as early as possible in the course of the outbreak.

* Initiation of public health investigation: The initiation of a public health investigation occurs when a decision is made to acquire additional data. Analysis and judgment are applied by public health-care providers to the processed surveillance data and other available information to decide whether new data collection is warranted to confirm the existence of an outbreak. The challenge of interpreting data from multiple surveillance systems could diminish potential advantages in timeliness. The focus on outbreak detection allows for investigations of potential outbreaks to proceed before a specific clinical diagnosis is obtained.

* Initiation of public health intervention: When an outbreak of public health significance is confirmed, interventions can be implemented to control the severity of disease and prevent further spread. Interventions might be of a general nature directed to the recognition of an outbreak (e.g., apply respiratory infection precautions and obtain clinical specimens for diagnosis) or can be specific to the diagnosis (e.g., antibiotic prophylaxis or vaccination).

Electronic laboratory reporting (i.e., the automated transfer of designated data from a laboratory database to a public health data repository using a defined message structure) also will improve the timeliness and completeness of reporting notifiable conditions (6-8) and can serve as a model for electronic reporting of a wider range of clinical information.

Measurement of usefulness is inexact. As with validity, measurement will benefit from common terminology and standard data elements. In the interim, detailed efforts to describe and illustrate the consequences of early detection efforts will improve understanding of their usefulness.

Evaluation should begin with a review of the objectives of the system and should consider the priorities. To the extent possible, usefulness should be described by the disease prevention and control actions taken as a result of the analysis and interpretation of the data from the system.

The impact of the surveillance system should be contrasted with other mechanisms available for outbreak detection. An assessment of usefulness should list the outbreaks detected and the role that different methods played in the identification of each one. Examples of how the system has been used to detect or track health problems other than outbreaks in the community should be included. The public health response to the outbreaks and health problems detected should be described as well as how data from new or modified surveillance systems support inferences about disease patterns that would not be possible without them.","Surveillance systems for early outbreak detection are sometimes justified for the reassurance they provide when aberrant patterns are not apparent during a heightened risk period or when the incidence of cases declines during an outbreak. When community reassurance is claimed as a benefit of the surveillance system, reassurance should be defined and the measurement quantified (e.g., number of phone calls from the public on a health department hotline, successful press conferences, satisfaction of public health decision-makers, or resources to institutionalize the new surveillance system).

If the data are to be used to implement immediate disease control and prevention activities for infectious diseases that are acute, severe, and highly transmissible, timeliness is critical. 

Timeliness requirements for a surveillance system might vary by different levels of public health system (e.g., local, state, or national), on the basis of the intended uses of the surveillance data at that level (Table 1).

Electronic reporting may increase reporting timeliness.

From this viewpoint, the attribute of acceptability encompassed data collection as well as a range of additional factors when considered in relation to data analysis, interpretation, and dissemination. The relevance of acceptability in relation to the ACCISS was linked to numerous factors, each of which consistently interrelated to each respective attribute of a good surveillance system and surveillance activities. Some of these factors included: the affordability of the data management tools; positive hands-on learning experiences associated with seeing and working with injury data; the capacity to self-generate reports; the ability to produce data that was considered relevant in the day-to-day work of staff; and the capacity of each project community to independently respond to emerging injury issues.

Further, acceptability as described in the WHO guidelines does not explicitly address cultural relevance, yet several key aspects important to First Nations were found to be connected with acceptability. These aspects related to the: system working well within varied community populations and geographic environments; adaptability of the system in the face of varied skill sets; and data collection networks tailored to operate in relation to community-specific infrastructures. Another critical factor was the central importance and application of principles related to ownership, control, access, and possession, otherwise known as OCAP principles [27]. Acceptability was transparently linked to the cultural relevance of the ACCISS.

These elements were assessed using a combination of participatory diagraming and scoring tools, both of which were developed for, and adapted to, this specific context. Three main tools were implemented: (i) relational diagrams, (ii) flow diagrams (associated with proportional piling), and (iii)impact diagrams (associated with proportional piling). These tools were implemented with all participants, either through focus groups or through individual semi-structured interviews.

OASIS flash evaluation of acceptability:
The assessment of acceptability was based on 20 criteria according to the OASIS flash method, which can be grouped into 8 main categories: the organization of the surveillance system (e.g., existence of a charter), its animation (e.g., meetings frequencies), and organization (e.g., integration of laboratories in the system), the human and material resources, feedback to stakeholders, consequences of a suspicion, training provided, partnerships and stakeholder sensitization.","Acceptability is relevant to different aspects of the surveillance system. It first refers to the actors' acceptance of the system's objectives and of the way it is operates. The acceptance of the way the system operates refers to (i) the role of each actor and the representation of their own utility, (ii) the consequences of the flow of information for each actor (i.e., changes in their activity and in their relations following a suspicion), (iii) the perception by each actor of the importance and recognition of their own role relative to that of other actors, and (iv) the relations between stakeholders. Trust is another essential element of acceptability; trust in the system and also trust in other stakeholders involved in the system.","Objective: Is the objective(s) of the surveillance system in the line with the stakeholders' expected objective(s)?;

This method has been used by economists to value changes in natural resources and environments, and it is somewhat similar to methods used in marketing to evaluate new concepts for goods and products (Louviere et al., 2003). This method consists of direct interviews during which facilitators ask individuals what they would be willing to pay for a change (Louviere et al., 2003); in the present study, they were asked what they would be willing to pay for sanitary information related to ASF.

Most commonly Data completeness is measured as the proportion of records with missing or invalid data in the data fields – where data fields are variables containing demographic, clinical, pathologic or epidemiological information recorded for each sample. Key data fields (eg animal id, holding of origin, diagnostic result etc) should be identified and the proportion of completeness measured. Measurement of the proportion of records or observations that have been collated in the data system may also be considered.

Most commonly Data completeness is measured as the proportion of records with missing or invalid data in the data fields – where data fields are variables containing demographic, clinical, pathologic or epidemiological information recorded for each sample. Key data fields (eg animal id, holding of origin, diagnostic result etc) should be identified and the proportion of completeness measured. Measurement of the proportion of records or observations that have been collated in the data system may also be considered.

This information will be valuable to the economic evaluation in section 4 of the framework document. An evaluation of the benefits of a surveillance activity should include : 1. A complete list and characterisation of all the potential benefits of the surveillance activity 2. Where possible, quantify market benefits in financial terms 3. Where possible, quantify non-monetary benefits by alternative methods. For example, Quality-adjusted life years for public health benefits (HM Treasury 2003, Zinsstag et al 2007) or using points-system (Dufour 1999)4. Consider how the benefits are distributed among stakeholders, including: producers, consumers, the livestock industry or society. Points to consider whilst assessing the benefits of surveillance include:- Surveillance and disease control are often integrated: That is to say, surveillance provides information that informs control and so many benefits of surveillance are often realised by control measures. As with costs, it is important to understand the benefits of surveillance in the broader context of disease mitigation. Benefits of surveillance may be considered as disease losses and mitigation costs avoided by detection of disease. So it may be useful to begin by listing all the losses and  costs resulting from disease and disease mitigation measures. It may be difficult in some instances to distinguish between the direct benefits of surveillance and  those arising from mitigation. - The benefits of surveillance for early detection of disease outbreaks can be quantified as the losses and costs avoided through earlier detection and control - The primary benefit of surveillance providing evidence of disease freedom is access to international markets (for both live animals and animal products). The economic value of international trade can be attributed as a benefit to surveillance. Officially recognised disease-free status often permits the disease-free country/region to maintain border security measures against introduction of the disease (eg restriction on trade and movement of animals or requirement for pre-export testing) - thus mitigation of risk of incursion is also a benefit of surveillance for freedom from disease.. - Surveillance for case-detection and monitoring prevalence of endemic disease provides information for the improved control and management of disease; including prioritisation of diseases and allocation of resources. - Improved public health is an obvious advantage to surveillance for zoonoses. Increased consumer confidence is another - although consumer confidence may also be of significance to other high-profile, non-zoonotic diseases. - Consider potential indirect or secondary benefits of surveillance; externalities or spill-over of benefit to other livestock sectors or industries. It may be helpful to  consider potential benefits both upstream (eg animal feed producers) and  downstream (eg food processors) of the production system. Examining the value  chain will aid in this.

Usually (if not always) refers to endemic diseases. Bias is reduced as representativeness is increased. , ,,N/A,"Assessing the bias of a system is most relevant to surveillance of endemic diseases where the objective is to monitor the prevalence of a disease. Bias may lead to erroneous conclusions about the burden or distribution of disease in the population. For some surveillance activities - such as risk-based surveillance aimed at detecting cases to facilitate control - surveillance may be intentionally biased toward sub-groups of the population at higher risk of disease. So the context and objective of surveillance will determine whether bias is acceptable or not. Either way, an evaluation of bias should include: 1. An assessment of whether any prevalence estimates produced are likely to be biased based on an assessment of the potential sources of bias in a surveillance system and its outputs; 2. Where possible bias should be quantified and the outputs adjusted accordingly. Bias in epidemiology may be categorised into misclassification bias and selection bias: - Misclassification bias concerns the sensitivity and specificity of the case-definition (often intimate to the diagnostic protocol); - Selection bias results when the probability of being sampled is associated with the probability of disease (and therefore the probability of other factors associated with disease).In this regard the bias, sensitivity, specificity, coverage and representativeness of a surveillance system are related concepts. Bias in the prevalence estimates obtained using surveillance data may result from poor sensitivity, specificity, coverage or representativeness in the system. Some potential sources of bias to consider include: - Sensitivity/specificity of the diagnostic method; - Under-reporting in passive surveillance activities; - The sample source population: For example, sampling at abattoirs may lead to an under-estimate of the prevalence of many diseases as these animals are from a healthy (and younger) sub-population, whereas sampling fallen stock may lead to an over-estimate of burden; - Selection bias may also be introduced in terms of geography, production type, herd/flock size, species or age category of the animal. Bias in the surveillance output can be examined and quantified by several methods: - Simple comparison of multiple surveillance data sources examining the same population. In some instances a separate survey might be designed and implemented to specifically examine potential biases (eg a postal survey to explore under-reporting in passive surveillance activities); - More sophisticated statistical or simulation methods can be applied to existing data (* Capture-Recapture (CRC) methods have been applied to make inferences about the unobserved cases and so the completeness of surveillance data (Del Rio Vilas and Bohning 2008, Guasticchi et al, 2009, ); * Morignat et al (2006) used simulation models to explore potential biases (identified a priori) in scrapie surveillance data; * Mathematical models might also be used to simulate the spread of disease and generation of surveillance data to explore potential bias in the system.If bias can be identified and measured, then it should be possible to adjust the prevalence estimate.); - Correcting an estimate of prevalence for incomplete test accuracy is easily achieved with knowledge of the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic protocol (see equation 5.16 in Doohoo et al 2003). Prevalence estimates can also be adjusted for selection bias where the strength of association (ie relative risk or odds ratio) and the distribution of the risk factors in the background population are known (Wells et al 2009, Williams et al 2009).; - Morignat et al (2006) uses simulation methods to both explore and partially correct of bias in surveillance data. If bias is deemed to be significant and unacceptable and cannot be satisfactorily corrected for during analysis and interpretation of the data, one might consider reviewing the design and implementation of the surveillance activity.

Consider also how the costs of surveillance are divided among the stakeholders (e.g. what is paid for directly by the producer, by industry levy or public funds). Considering the distribution of surveillance costs and benefits is an important part of economic analyses.

A high coverage is particularly important to surveillance for the early detection of exotic or new (emerging) diseases. An assessment of coverage should include: 1. At the very least, the sampled and target populations should be characterised and compared qualitatively; 2. Where sufficient data on the target population exists, simple calculations of the proportion coverage can be made (eg 75% of the national herd and 45% of cattle holdings are sampled annually).; 3. Where sufficient information on the background population is lacking, more sophisticated statistical techniques might be employed (eg Capture-Recapture analysis). Some considerations when assessing the coverage of a surveillance activity are the target population and the unit of interest: Coverage should be measured against the population of interest (the target population) as defined in section 2 of the framework. This may not include all animals or holdings in a country that are susceptible (eg post-import testing of cattle say is focussed on a sub-population of holdings that receive livestock from overseas and not all holdings keeping cattle). At this point, it may be worth considering whether the target population has been adequately defined (ie whether the exclusion of certain animals or holdings is merited). The unit of interest—in which the level of coverage is measured—is often the unit of interest of surveillance (eg animal or holding). If insufficient data exists for this, or alternative perspectives are desired, coverage might be assessed at other aggregate levels (eg geographical areas) or relevant intermediate steps in the surveillance pathway (eg the proportion of veterinary practices submitting diagnostic samples, private laboratories submitting data or participating abattoirs or markets). In certain contexts it may be worth establishing a timeframe of reference (eg annual coverage).

An assessment of participation should include the identification of the factors likely to increase or prevent stakeholder participation and an assessment of the likely impact of these factors on levels of participation.

Qualitative or semi-quantitative social science approaches are likely to be of value in assessing participation. Consultation with all those involved in generating, analysing, reporting and using surveillance data will be valuable.

Factors that may influence participation include:

- What communication pathways exist internal to the surveillance system (eg between those collecting or providing data and those analysing and reporting the data)? Are these pathways formalised in any fashion? 
- Does information and feedback flow freely between those implementing surveillance and those using surveillance data?
- How are each of the key stakeholders represented in the planning, design and implementation stages of the surveillance activity?

An evaluation of the flexibility of the system may be made by considering how the surveillance system has responded to changes in the past. Potential changes or events to consider include:

- Changes in the information needs of the users of surveillance
- Changes in relevant national or international legislation or guidelines
- Changes in the demography of the target population
- Changes in the epidemiology of disease (including outbreaks) or the emergence of new disease threats
- Changes or improvements to the methods of surveillance, including adoption of new technologies (eg development of new diagnostic methods)
- Changes to behaviour or influences on behaviour of key actors and agents in the system (eg changes to reporting behaviour or the costs of diagnostic services)

An assessment of how likely it is that such changes may occur in the future and whether the surveillance system would be able to respond to these changes should also be made.

Assessment of this attribute will be aided by consultation with key stakeholders of the system.

Firstly one should assess the realised multiple utility of the system but it will also be of benefit to assess the potential multiple utility - an outcome of assessing potential multiple utility might be recommendations on how to add value to the system currently implemented. An assessment of multiple utility should consider: - What additional information is or could be gathered during sample collection (eg on animal health or husbandry and demographics)? - What other types of samples are or could be collected at the time of sampling? - What other diseases are or could be tested for with the samples collected? - How long are samples stored following testing and could they be used for other purposes (including other research purposes)? For a surveillance system to offer value to other diseases or information needs, the objectives and processes of the system should be aligned to other systems. So it may be expected that more simple systems are likely to have more potential for multiple utility. For example, a simple random survey of holdings, repeated annually and with good coverage and representativeness could be useful for various diseases; whereas a risk-based design aimed at a specific threat may be of limited value for other diseases with differing epidemiology.

As such, the first step will be to identify and characterise key characteristics of the target population upon which to measure representativeness. These characteristics might be risk factors for the disease threat - knowledge of the associations between these characteristics, selection in the sample population and disease will inform the understanding of bias. Examples of relevant features include:

- Livestock sector or production type
- Herd/flock size
- Age, sex or purpose of animal
- Geographic location

The second consideration of assessing representativeness is whether there is sufficient and accurate data on the identified features in both the target and sample populations. 


Where sufficient data exists, representativeness might be explored through:

- simple descriptive analyses
- statistical analyses (eg cross-tabulation and regression techniques, or Capture-Recapture methods)
- spatial visualisation, exploration and analyses with GIS (Geographic Information Systems) tools

This requires a clear definition of what constitutes an outbreak; (3) Surveillance sensitivity (presence) refers to the probability that disease will be detected if present at a certain level (prevalence) in the population., ,,N/A,"Sensitivity is the most commonly assessed attribute of surveillance systems. Combined with timeliness, it is of particular importance to surveillance for early detection of outbreaks. With representativeness it is frequently scrutinised when evaluating surveillance activities intended to provide evidence for disease freedom. When monitoring the prevalence of endemic diseases, poor sensitivity will contribute to bias in the surveillance outputs.

Surveillance sensitivity (case detection)can be assessed by 

- Comparing prevalence estimates from multiple systems or studies (Lynn et al 2007)
- Considering biases and limitations in the data available and their likely impact on the estimate of sensitivity.
- Using statistical methods like capture recapture methods to address the issue of availability of gold standard comparison (del Rio Vilas et al 2005, del Rio Vilas and Bohning, 2008)
- Bayesian approaches can also be useful to estimate sensitivity (Branscum et al, 2006) in the absence of a reference test or population.

Surveillance sensitivity (outbreak detection) can be assessed by

- Quantifying the proportion of outbreaks of disease detected by a specific surveillance component
- Applying simulation modelling methods (Audigé and Becket 1999, Willeberg et al 2011). 
- In the public health field the methods used to assess the ability of detection algorithms to detect outbreaks have been reviewed (Buckeridge, 2007, Watkins et al 2006) These include comparing the outbreaks detected by these outbreaks to previously identified outbreaks in recorded data or to simulated outbreaks sumperimposed on surveillance data (Mandl et al 2004, Jackson et al 2007).

Surveillance sensitivity (presence) can be assessed by

- Considering whether the design of the system is likely to achieve the sensitivity specified in the design of the system 
- Using probabilistic methods or other methods (Martin et al 2007, Hood et al 2009)
- Sensitivity (presence) is usually used to assess surveillance for demonstrating freedom but can also assess performance of surveillance for early detection

Some considerations when assessing the sensitivity of surveillance include

- The probability of selection into the surveillance system must be defined and quantified. This may be a simple random sample of animals from a single homogenous population or a complex pathway of epidemiologic and behavioural factors describing the observation, reporting and subsequent investigation of notifiable disease (ie passive surveillance)
- The probability of diagnosis (ie the sensitivity of the diagnostic protocol, including that of laboratory tests)
- The choice of design prevalence (ie the expected prevalence of disease that the system is designed to detect) is a key assumption. Setting a very low design prevalence will result in a low estimate of sensitivity, placing unreasonable demand upon resources; whereas setting a high design prevalence will give an inflated estimate of sensitivity, thereby undermining credibility of the result. Choice of the design prevalence should be based upon understanding of the epidemiology of the disease. Sometimes legislation offers guidance on the design prevalence of surveillance for exotic diseases.

The inverse of this is the false alarm rate, ,,N/A,"Evaluation of the specificity of a surveillance system is especially important for surveillance activities designed to detect outbreaks and cases because it is related to the misdirection of resources: ie expenditure on disease investigation and mitigation measures that are needlessly applied. The specificity of many surveillance activities will be very high or complete (100%), because of the consequences of confirming disease; this is especially true for surveillance for exotic diseases carrying implications for trade. 

Specificity can be considered at several levels, depending upon the epidemiology of the disease and the objectives and design of the system:

- the specificity of pre-diagnostic indicators of disease (eg clinical signs)
- the specificity of screening and confirmatory diagnostic tests applied
- the rate of false-positive signals raised by detection algorithms applied to surveillance data
- the proportion of reports of suspect cases of disease that are subsequently negated (NB this metric actually concerns the Positive Predictive Value of a system; a related concept which has been assessed in some evaluations

The time points chosen are likely to vary depending on the purpose of the surveillance activity. For outbreak detection this can be defined using various time points including the time between exposure to the infectious agent and the initiation of risk mitigation measures or the time between when disease could have been detected and when it actually was reported. For planning purposes, timeliness can also be defined as whether surveillance detects changes in time for risk mitigation measures to reduce the likelihood of further spread.

The precise definition of timeliness chosen should be stated as part of the evaluation process.

For surveillance systems designed to detect cases of disease the CDC guidelines (CDC 2001) describe a useful approach to measuring the timeliness of a surveillance system which is focussed on the time taken to process surveillance data. In brief:

1. Map the surveillance process, from sample collection and handling, through the diagnostic process, management and analysis of data and reporting and dissemination of results. The description of the surveillance system developed in section 2 of the framework will aid in this.
2. Identify key time intervals for measurement. The timeliness measure should be aligned with the objectives of the system and in some cases more than one measure may be required to gain sufficient understanding. Some examples of relevant timeliness measures include:
a. For passive surveillance activities, the interval between observation of the first clinical signs of disease and laboratory investigation
b. For post-import testing for exotic notifiable disease, the interval between entry to the country and the return of a laboratory result
c. For ongoing active surveillance of endemic diseases, one measure might be the frequency of analysis and publication of surveillance data
3. Just as the timeliness measure may differ between systems, the criterion for timeliness will differ between disease threats. The timeliness of a system should be assessed with consideration of the epidemiology of the disease of interest (eg by comparison to the generation interval of infectious diseases)
4. When the key time intervals have been identified and fully characterised, data should be collected to measure the timeliness. Where sufficient event data exists, calculations will be relatively simple. In the absence of sufficient valid data, simulation models might be developed and applied.
5. Assessment should also consider factors which influence the timeliness of a system. For example, availability of human resources for the collection of samples of investigation of reported disease, availability of laboratory facilities, adoption of new technology to streamline laboratory investigation, adoption of automated approaches to the collation and management or the analysis and reporting of surveillance data, etc.

Examples of studies assessing the timeliness of surveillance for case detection include Jajosky and Groseclose, 2004 and Takahoshi et al 2004

For surveillance systems designed to detect outbreaks, timeliness is often assessed in combination with sensitivity (Kleinman and Abrams 2008). Guidance on the assessment of timeliness for this type of surveillance system is provided by the CDC framework (2004) which focuses more on the time taken to detect outbreaks. Timeliness for these surveillance systems has been assessed by:

- assessing the time to detect naturally occurring outbreaks (Siegrist et al, 2004) 
- assessing the time to detect simulated outbreaks (Mandl et al 2004, Jackson et al 2007) 
- using a simulation model to predict the time to detect outbreaks (Yamamoto et al, 2008)

As with Benefits, the Impact of surveillance in some cases may be realised through its relationship with disease control measures (Haesler et al 2011).

Who are they intended for and how well received are they?; - What questions have been asked of the surveillance data previously and have these information needs been met?; - How has information generated by the surveillance system influenced the development of national or international disease control policy (eg changes to requirements for surveillance or control of disease)?; - How has information generated by the surveillance system contributed to the prioritisation of disease threats within the industry, country or globally?; - How has the surveillance system contributed to mitigation of endemic disease or earlier detection and control of exotic disease outbreaks?

Two measurements resulting from population coverage assessment are 1) population undercoverage that results from the omission of respondents or cases belonging to the target population and 2) population overcoverage that occurs because of inclusion of elements that do not belong to the target population. In addition, a demographic analysis (26) can provide benchmarks for assessing completeness of coverage in the existing surveillance data and document changes in coverage from previous periods. Furthermore, independence and internal consistency of the demographic analysis allow using estimates to check survey-based coverage estimates. ","Surveillance systems (ie, survey-based or hospital- or facility-based surveillance) can be defined by their geographic catchment area (ie, country, region, state, county, or city) or by the target population that the system is intended to capture. For example, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health's target population is the noninstitutionalized civilian population aged 12 years or older. Homeless people who do not use shelters, active duty military personnel, and residents of institutional group quarters (eg, correctional facilities, nursing homes, mental institutions, and long-term hospitals) are excluded. Such populations not covered by most surveillance systems can contribute to case counts in hospital- or facility-based systems (eg, drug poisoning, emergency department use for self-harm, prevalence of mental illness and substance abuse problems). Evaluation of population coverage typically requires an alternative data source. For example, the estimate from a national surveillance system can be compared with a special study or survey in the same geographic area targeting a specific population. Projections from previous estimates might aid in comparing existing surveillance data. Use of benchmark data sets might aid in estimating the undercoverage prevalence of behavioral health indicators: the US Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics data (https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=dca) and the US Department of Housing of Urban Development's (http:// portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD) point-in-time estimates of homelessness. Finally, mortality data will contain all US residents' deaths occurring in a given year; however, residents who die abroad might not be included (resulting in undercoverage), and deaths of nonresidents might be included (resulting in overcoverage).

Complete data have no missing values; valid data have no error (bias) caused by invalid codes or systematic deviation.AP52, ,,"For behavioral surveillance, measures of statistical stability (relative standard error) and precision (random variability and bias) are important. Completeness can be assessed at the item level (are values of a variable missing at random or clustering according to some characteristic?). Evaluation of completeness of the overall surveillance system can vary by data source. Completeness of a survey can be assessed by examining the sample frame (does it exclude groups of respondents?), sampling methodology, survey mode, imputation, weighting, and ranking methods (18). For behavioral surveillance based on medical records, consideration should be given to the completeness of all fields, standardization across reporting units (eg, medical records systems), coding process, and specific nomenclature (eg, for drugs and treatment). For surveillance based on death certificates, variability in death scene investigation procedures, presence of a medical examiner versus a coroner, reporting standards across geographic boundaries, and the process of death certification will be relevant. 

Assessment of validity (ie, measurement of what is intended to be measured) also varies by data source. For use of data from a survey, consider cognitive testing of questions, focus groups, comparison with information from a health care provider, and identification of external factors that might influence reporting in a systematic way (19). An example of systematic influence is discrimination or prejudice in any form of arbitrary distinction, exclusion, or restriction affecting a person, usually (but not only) because of an inherent personal characteristic or perceived membership of a particular group (20).

Evaluation of statistical stability (precision) involves calculation of relative standard error of the primary estimate. Assessment of bias (systematic error) should address the following:
* Selection bias: systematic differences between sample and target populations
* Performance bias: systematic differences between groups in care provided or in exposure to factors other than the interventions of interest
* Detection bias: systematic differences in how the outcome is determined (eg, death scene investigation protocols)
* Attrition bias: systematic loss to follow up
* Reporting bias: systematic differences in how people report symptoms or ideation
* Other: biases related to a particular data source
","Many data-quality definitions depend on other system performance attributes (eg, timeliness, usefulness, acceptability) (21). Because of reliance on multiple data sources, data quality must be assessed in different ways. For surveillance relying on surveys, concepts of reliability, validity, and comparison with alternative data sources are important.

First, PVP for outbreak detection is related to resources; if every reported case of suicide ideation is investigated and the community involved is given a thorough intervention, PVP can be high, but at a prohibitive expense. A surveillance system with low PVP (frequent false-positive case reports) might lead to misdirected resources. Thus, the proportion of epidemics identified by the surveillance system that are true epidemics can be used to assess PVP. Review of personnel activity reports, travel records, and telephone logbooks may be useful. Second, PVP might be calculated by analyzing the number of case investigations completed and the proportion of reported persons who actually had the behavioral health-related event. However, use of data external to the system (eg, medical records, registries, and death certificates) might be necessary for confirming cases as well as calculating more than one measurement of the attribute (eg, for the system's data fields, for each data source or combination of data sources, for specific health-related events).","Although the definition of PVP is the same as for infectious conditions, measuring PVP for behavioral health surveillance is hindered by a lack of easily measurable true positives as a result of stigma, communication, or cultural factors.

Examination of groups systematically excluded by the surveillance data source (eg, prisoners, homeless or institutionalized persons, freestanding emergency departments, people aged ≥ 65 in Veterans Affairs systems) can help to assess representativeness. An independent source of data regarding the outcome of interest is also helpful. Using behavioral health event data requires calculation of rates for a given year or for monitoring temporal trends. These will use denominator data from external data sources (eg, US Census Bureau ) that should be carefully ascertained for the targeted population. These considerations facilitate representation of health events in terms of time, place, and person.","Generalizing the findings of surveillance to the overall population should be possible with data captured from the surveillance system. Although sensitivity is the proportion of all health events of interest captured by the system, representativeness quantifies whether the data system accurately reflects the distribution of the condition or affected individuals in the general population (ie, whether systematic errors exist). For example, because many emergency departments and trauma centers that treat acute injuries test only a limited proportion of patients for alcohol, data regarding alcohol involvement in nonfatal injuries might not be representative of alcohol involvement in injuries overall. Generalization from these findings on alcohol involvement in nonfatal injuries to all persons who have experienced these outcomes is problematic. Alternative survey methods are useful — respondent- driven sampling (22), network scale-up methods (16), and time/date/location sampling (23). Evaluation of representativeness can prompt modification of data-collection methods or redefining and accessing the target population to accurately represent the population of interest.

* Health-related events, risk factors, or effects of public health policies are occurring in the population under surveillance
* Cases are coming to the attention of institutions (eg, health care, educational, community-based, harm-reduction, law enforcement, or survey-collection institutions) that report to a centralized system
* Cases will be identified, reflecting the abilities of health care providers; capacity of health care systems; type, quality, or availability of the screening tool; or survey implementation
* Events will be reported to the system. For example, in assessing sensitivity of a surveillance system based on a telephone-based survey, one can assess the 1) likelihood that people have telephones to take the call and agree to participate; 2) ability of respondents to understand the questions and correctly identify their status and risk factors, and 3) willingness of respondents to report their status

Because many important conditions for behavioral health surveillance are self-reported, validating or adjusting the self-report might be required using statistical methods (10), field-based studies (16), or methods in the absence of a gold standard (12-15).

Other factors related to behavioral health (eg, discrimination and variability in implementing parity in payment coverage between physical health and behavioral health care) can influence sensitivity, requiring alternative or parallel data sources. For example, when using surveys as a source for prevalence data, consider question redundancy or adding questions that might further identify people with a condition or leading indicator.

","An evaluation of the sensitivity of a behavioral health surveillance system should include a clear assessment of potential biases that range from case identification to case reporting.

system's data-collection methods and the level to which it is integ-
rated into other systems (9). For example, a surveillance system
might rely on multiple information sources for case finding and
data abstraction and for follow-up with confirmation by an inde-
pendent data source or by an expert review panel. Evaluating sim-
plicity would involve examining each data source individually and
how the system works as a whole or how easily it integrates with
other systems.

","As with infectious disease surveillance, behavioral health surveillance systems should be as simple as possible while still meeting the system's objective and purpose. Each behavioral health indicator or outcome should have a clear definition and be measurable in that surveillance system. Surveillance systems using population survey methods should have simple standard sampling methods (eg, paper-based, computer-based, or telephone-based), data processing (eg, data cleaning, screening, weighting, and editing or imputing), and data dissemination (eg,
reports, internet pages). Analysis of trends in behavioral health data assumes no change in variable definition(s) over time and that data elements are consistently defined when the numerator and denominator are taken from different data sources. This can entail defining or stabilizing a standard behavioral health case definition (eg, binge drinking differences between men and women) or diagnostic coding methods (eg, International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision [17]).

Timeliness of a behavioral health surveillance system should be associated with timing of a consequent response for detecting a change in historical trends, outbreaks, or policy to control or prevent adverse health consequences. For example, quick identification and referral is needed for people experiencing a first episode of psychosis. However, for a community detecting an increase in binge-drinking rates, a longer period will be needed because the public health response requires a systemic engagement at the community level. Specific factors that can influence timeliness include
* Delays from symptom onset to diagnosis resulting from stigma (people might avoid diagnosis), lack of access to a facility or practitioner for diagnosis, policy (providers might be unable to bill for behavioral health diagnoses), credentials (relying on medical records or insurance claims misses people without insurance), or a failure to diagnose to avoid labeling

* Symptoms that appear intermittently

* Delays in recognizing a cluster or outbreak caused by lack of baseline data","For behavioral health conditions, long periods can occur between precedent symptoms, behavior, conditions, or exposure duration and the final appearance or diagnosis of a disease or condition. Unlike immediate identification and reporting needed for infectious diseases, some behavioral health conditions, similar to chronic conditions, might develop more slowly; for example, posttraumatic stress disorder (which often occurs in response to a particular traumatic event over time) versus an episodic depression (which may occur in response to an acute event). Nonetheless, baseline data are vital for determining the urgency of timely response to outbreaks or clusters of health problems related to behavioral health conditions.

easily measureable as most chronic or infectious disease measures, and their etiology or disease progression is often not as linear.",N/A,,,N/A,timeliness,timeliness,Effectiveness attributes,Evidence quality attributes,Timeliness,timeliness,Pending,Pending,Surveillance effectiveness,Data quality,N/A,N/A,accessibility

These avoided losses may include the avoidance of: * Primary industry production losses * Human mortality and morbidity * Economic losses * Decrease in consumer confidence * Threatened livelihoods * Harmed ecosystems * Utility loss * Loss of sociocultural values Often, the benefit of surveillance estimated as losses avoided can only be realised by implementing an intervention. Hence, it is necessary to also assess the effect of the intervention and look at surveillance, intervention and loss avoidance as a three-variable relationship. Further benefits of surveillance include maintained or increased trade, improved ability to react in case of an outbreak of a disease or incursion of a risk organism, maintaining a structured network of professionals able to react appropriately against a (future) threat, maintaining a critical level of infrastructure for disease/risk organism control, increased understanding about a disease or risk organism, and improved ability to react in case of an outbreak of a disease or incursion of a risk organism. The benefits of a surveillance activity should be listed and, where possible, quantified. An evaluation of the benefits of a surveillance activity may include: * A characterisation of all the potential benefits of the surveillance activity * A description of benefits as perceived by the relevant stakeholders * Where possible, quantify market benefits in financial terms * Where possible, quantify non-monetary benefits by alternative methods * Consider how the benefits are distributed among stakeholders, including: producers, consumers, the livestock industry or society. Points to consider whilst assessing the benefits of surveillance include: * Surveillance and disease or risk organism control are often integrated: That is to say, surveillance provides information that informs control and so many benefits of surveillance are often realised by control measures. As with costs, it is important to understand the benefits of surveillance in the broader context of disease or risk organism mitigation. Benefits of surveillance may be considered as disease or risk organism losses and mitigation costs avoided by detection of a disease or risk organism. So it may be useful to begin by listing all the losses and costs resulting from a disease or risk organism, and disease or risk organism mitigation measures. It may be difficult in some instances to distinguish between the direct benefits of surveillance and those arising from mitigation. * The benefits of surveillance for early detection of disease or risk organism outbreaks can be quantified as the losses and costs avoided through earlier detection and control. * The primary benefit of surveillance providing evidence of disease or risk organism freedom is access to international markets. The economic value of international trade can be attributed as a benefit to surveillance. Officially recognised disease or risk organism-free status often permits the disease or risk organism-free country/region to maintain border security measures against introduction of the disease (e.g. restriction on trade and movement of risk goods or requirement for pre-export testing) - thus mitigation of risk of incursion is also a benefit of surveillance for freedom from disease or risk organisms. * Surveillance for case-detection and monitoring prevalence of endemic disease or presence of risk organisms provides information for the improved control and management of disease and risk organisms; including prioritisation of diseases and risk organisms and allocation of resources. * Improved public health is an obvious advantage to surveillance for zoonoses. Increased consumer confidence is another - although consumer confidence may also be of significance to other high-profile, non- zoonotic diseases. * Consider potential indirect or secondary benefits of surveillance; e.g. externalities or spill over of benefit to other sectors or industries. It may be helpful to consider potential benefits both upstream (e.g. animal feed producers) and downstream (e.g. value-added producers) of the production system. Examining the value chain will aid in this.

Bias describes the extent to which a prevalence or population density estimate produced by the surveillance system deviates from the true prevalence or population density value. Bias is reduced as representativeness is increased. The representativeness of a surveillance system is related to coverage and bias; it is a comparison of the sample and target populations or specific areas of interest with regard to a number of key features or risk factors. Features taken into account when considering representativeness could include, for example, production type, species, geographic location, habitat preferences and environmental parameters. Bias can be divided into two main types: information and selection bias. Information bias results from systematic differences in the way information is collected, for example on the presence or absence of a disease or a risk. Selection bias occurs when there is a systematic difference between the individuals/samples/transects included and those that are not. Some potential sources of bias to consider include: * Sensitivity/specificity of the methods applied. * Under-reporting in passive surveillance activities. * The sample source population: For example in animal surveillance, sampling at abattoirs may lead to an under- estimate of the prevalence of many diseases as these animals are from a healthy (and younger) sub-population, whereas sampling fallen stock may lead to an over- estimate of burden. Similarly, in marine surveillance sampling a receiving location may lead to an underestimate of risk organism incursions, whereas sampling vectors or pathways will provide an over estimate of invasion success. * Selection bias may also be introduced in terms of geography, habitat, population size, organism traits, species, age, sex or purpose. As such, the first step will be to identify key characteristics of the target population or areas of interest upon which to measure representativeness. These characteristics might be risk factors for the disease or organism threat - knowledge of the associations between these characteristics, selection in the sample population/environment and disease/organism will inform the understanding of bias. Examples of relevant features include: * Species * Population or group size (e.g. herd size) * System type or focus (e.g. production type) * Age, sex or purpose * Geographic location * Habitat * Presence/absence or frequency of vectors The second consideration in assessing representativeness is whether there are sufficient and accurate data on the identified features in both the target and sample populations. Bias may lead to erroneous conclusions about the burden or distribution of disease in the population or an organism in an environment. For some surveillance activities - such as risk- based surveillance aimed at detecting cases to facilitate control - surveillance may be intentionally biased toward sub- groups of the population at higher risk of disease or geographic locations and habitat strata where the occurrence of risk organisms is more likely. So the context and objective of surveillance will determine whether bias is acceptable or not. Bias in the surveillance output can be examined and quantified by several methods (see Methods Catalogue: Appendix 1). If bias is deemed to be significant and unacceptable and cannot be satisfactorily corrected for during analysis and interpretation of the data, one might consider reviewing the design and implementation of the surveillance activity.

For example, the collection of slaughterhouse records can provide information on the presence/absence of several diseases and risk organisms. Multiple utility in a system should be considered when examining the cost-effectiveness of a system. It may also be of benefit to assess the potential multiple utility which may provide recommendations on how to add value to the system currently implemented. An assessment of multiple utility could consider: * What additional information is or could be gathered during sample collection (e.g. on animal health or husbandry and demographics; or other endemic/native/cryptogenic/non- native organisms that are present or absent)? * What other types of samples are or could be collected at the time of sampling (e.g. environmental)? * What other diseases/risk organisms are or could be tested for with the samples collected? * How long are samples stored following testing and could they be used for other purposes (including other research purposes)? For a surveillance system to offer value to other diseases/risk organisms or information needs, the objectives and processes of the system should be aligned to other systems. So it may be expected that more generic systems are likely to have more potential for multiple utility. For example, a simple random survey of holdings or geographical locations, repeated annually and with good coverage and representativeness could be useful for various diseases/risk organisms; whereas a risk-based design aimed at a specific threat may be of limited value for other diseases/risk organisms with differing epidemiology, host-range, life history or habitat preferences ",N/A,,,N/A,multipleUtility,multipleUtility,Effectiveness attributes,Inclusion attributes,Multiple utility,multi-utility,Pending,Pending,Integration and stability,Resiliency,N/A,N/A,Pending

Bias describes the extent to which a prevalence or population density estimate produced by the surveillance system deviates from the true prevalence or population density value. Bias is reduced as representativeness is increased. The representativeness of a surveillance system is related to coverage and bias; it is a comparison of the sample and target populations or specific areas of interest with regard to a number of key features or risk factors. Features taken into account when considering representativeness could include, for example, production type, species, geographic location, habitat preferences and environmental parameters. Bias can be divided into two main types: information and selection bias. Information bias results from systematic differences in the way information is collected, for example on the presence or absence of a disease or a risk. Selection bias occurs when there is a systematic difference between the individuals/samples/transects included and those that are not. Some potential sources of bias to consider include: * Sensitivity/specificity of the methods applied. * Under-reporting in passive surveillance activities. * The sample source population: For example in animal surveillance, sampling at abattoirs may lead to an under- estimate of the prevalence of many diseases as these animals are from a healthy (and younger) sub-population, whereas sampling fallen stock may lead to an over- estimate of burden. Similarly, in marine surveillance sampling a receiving location may lead to an underestimate of risk organism incursions, whereas sampling vectors or pathways will provide an over estimate of invasion success. * Selection bias may also be introduced in terms of geography, habitat, population size, organism traits, species, age, sex or purpose. As such, the first step will be to identify key characteristics of the target population or areas of interest upon which to measure representativeness. These characteristics might be risk factors for the disease or organism threat - knowledge of the associations between these characteristics, selection in the sample population/environment and disease/organism will inform the understanding of bias. Examples of relevant features include: * Species * Population or group size (e.g. herd size) * System type or focus (e.g. production type) * Age, sex or purpose * Geographic location * Habitat * Presence/absence or frequency of vectors The second consideration in assessing representativeness is whether there are sufficient and accurate data on the identified features in both the target and sample populations. Bias may lead to erroneous conclusions about the burden or distribution of disease in the population or an organism in an environment. For some surveillance activities - such as risk- based surveillance aimed at detecting cases to facilitate control - surveillance may be intentionally biased toward sub- groups of the population at higher risk of disease or geographic locations and habitat strata where the occurrence of risk organisms is more likely. So the context and objective of surveillance will determine whether bias is acceptable or not. Bias in the surveillance output can be examined and quantified by several methods (see Methods Catalogue: Appendix 1). If bias is deemed to be significant and unacceptable and cannot be satisfactorily corrected for during analysis and interpretation of the data, one might consider reviewing the design and implementation of the surveillance activity.

Sensitivity of a surveillance system should be considered according to the objective of the surveillance activity: 

* Surveillance sensitivity (case detection) refers to the proportion of individual units (e.g. animals, plants) that have the condition of interest that the surveillance system is designed to detect that are correctly identified as such,
* Surveillance sensitivity (outbreak or incursion detection) refers to the probability that the surveillance system will detect a significant event. 
This requires a clear definition of what constitutes a significant event (e.g. an outbreak, incursion, or host expansion).
* Surveillance sensitivity (presence) refers to the probability that an event will be detected if present at a certain level (prevalence) in the population.
Sensitivity is the most commonly assessed attribute of surveillance systems. Combined with timeliness, it is of particular importance to surveillance for early detection of outbreaks or incursions. Along with representativeness it is frequently scrutinised when evaluating surveillance activities intended to provide evidence for disease or risk organism freedom. When monitoring the prevalence of endemic diseases or risk organisms, poor sensitivity will contribute to bias in the surveillance outputs. 

Some considerations when assessing the sensitivity of surveillance include:

* The probability of selection into the surveillance system must be defined and quantified. This may be a simple random sample of animals from a single homogenous population or a complex pathway of epidemiologic and behavioural factors describing the observation, reporting 
and subsequent investigation of a notifiable disease or risk organism (i.e. passive surveillance).
* The probability of diagnosis (i.e. the sensitivity of the diagnostic protocol, including that of laboratory tests).
* The choice of design prevalence or assumed density (i.e. the expected prevalence of disease or density of a risk organism that the system is designed to detect) is a key assumption.
* In ecology, when the main aim is detection of a single pest organism, search efficiency (ability to detect the organism if it is there) could be taken into account",N/A,,,recall,sensitivity,sensitivity,Effectiveness attributes,Evidence quality attributes,Sensitivity,sensitivity,Pending,Pending,Surveillance effectiveness,Data quality,Ascertainment performance,N/A,Pending

The specificity of many surveillance activities will be very high or complete (100%), because of the  consequences of confirming disease; this is especially true for surveillance for exotic diseases carrying implications for trade. 

Specificity can be considered at several levels, depending upon the epidemiology of the disease or organism and the objectives and design of the system: 

* The specificity of pre-diagnostic indicators of disease (e.g. clinical signs).
* The specificity of screening and confirmatory diagnostic tests applied.
* The rate of false-positive signals raised by detection algorithms applied to surveillance data.
* The proportion of reports of suspect cases of a disease or risk organism that are subsequently negated (NB: this metric actually concerns the Positive Predictive Value of a system; a related concept which has been assessed in some evaluations).

Assessment of specificity should include the false alarm rate, i.e. the proportion of wrongly suspected outbreaks or incursions.

","Availability: Availability means ""is the system operational when needed""",,N/A,"Reliability means ""does the system function without failure"" and availability means ""is the system operational when needed"". These attributes can be measured retrospectively by * Looking at the incidence of minor and major faults over a defined period of time or * Measuring the proportion of time that the system is fully functional. Assessment of these attributes will benefit from consultation with those involved in the generation, management and analysis of surveillance data. If performance indicators have been implemented in the surveillance process, historical data from these will give a good insight into the ongoing functioning of the system. Repeatability means ""can the surveillance component performance be maintained consistently over time"" or ""how consistently can the results be reproduced over time"". Repeatability is often considered when validating diagnostic tests. A surveillance activity that performs well in this attribute produces data that are comparable across years and where changes to the data and data collection methods over time are clearly defined, understood and documented. In this context, one might consider changes to legislation; changes to diagnostic methods and sampling techniques, including improvements through adoption of new technology; changes to surveillance design; or influences on disease or risk organism reporting behaviour in passive surveillance activities. * How have these impacted on the comparability of surveillance data over the time period of interest? * Have these influences been identified and examined and can they be accommodated in interpretation of the surveillance data? Robustness means ""the ability to obtain comparable results over time"". It covers the ability of the surveillance system to produce acceptable outcomes over a range of assumptions about uncertainty by maximising the reliability of an adequate outcome.

Commonly timeliness relates to the time interval between a relevant event/signal and its recording by the surveillance system.

The timeliness of a surveillance system is especially important to surveillance for the early detection of emerging or exotic disease or organism threats - where the intention is to implement control measures as soon as possible. 

For example, for outbreak or incursion detection it might be important to consider the time delay from introduction to detection of the agent, or the time between when the agent should have realistically been first detected and the time when it actually was reported. On the other hand, for planning purposes, timeliness might be used to determine if a surveillance system detects and reports disease or risk organisms in time to initiate effective interventions before disease or risk organisms become widespread. 

Timeliness can be defined in various ways 

* This is usually defined as the time between any two defined steps in a surveillance system; the time points chosen are likely to vary depending on the purpose of the surveillance activity. 
* For planning purposes timeliness can also be defined as whether surveillance detects changes in time for risk mitigation measures to reduce the likelihood of further spread.

The first dimension refers to collaboration between sectoral institutions with different jurisdictions and mandates, mainly public health, animal health, plant health, environmental health and food safety. The second collaborative dimension concerns the engagement of different disciplines, among biosciences, social sciences and engineering. A third collaborative dimension can be described regarding collaboration between different decision-making scales. These scales include the different administrative jurisdictional scales within a same country (central, provincial and local authorities) but also the supra-national scales such as the international-scale (e.g. international organisations) or the regional-scale (e.g. regional economic communities). Within this dimension, the engagement of civil society must also be considered and is, for instance, clearly emphasised for two surveillance systems targeting rabies.

For early detection to succeed, three conditions must be met: (i) the first affected epidemiological unit must be included in the surveillance system, (ii) the unit must be examined or tested within the time frame specified and (iii) the test or examination must correctly detect the presence of disease.

If one or more confirmatory tests are used, it is the combined sensitivity of the test system depending on the interpretation of the combined test results.In a farmer-based clinical surveillance system, or community-based public health surveillance system, disease detection is the result of a cascade of steps (Martin et al., 2015). For example, in the case of clinical farmer-based detection of FMD, the steps include.* Infected animals show clinical signs of disease * Farmer notices affected animals * Farmer contacts veterinaria * Veterinarian suspects FMD and takes samples for laboratory confirmation * Laboratory tests samples for FMD * Test result is positive In this case, the sensitivity of the detection system is the product of the conditional probabilities of each of these steps. When syndromic pattern detection analysis is used, the detection sensitivity is the sensitivity of the system, including both the sensitivity of the analysis algorithm used to raise an alert and the sensitivity of the subsequent investigation used to confirm the outbreak. It is important to note that the time to detection represents the period starting when the disease becomes detectable and ending when action can be taken to prevent spread or to eradicate the disease. The regulatory requirements also play a role in time to first detection. When the new occurrence of a disease in a country has major consequences, it is important to ensure that the specificity of the detection system is extremely high, to avoid false positives.
